Code of Honor

- this barbarian species has transporters? gimme a break
- once they kidnapped Tasha, why not just beam up Tasha and the vaccine, and say "Next time, don't be dicks."?
- what was the point of the Prime Directive reference? was there interference with a pre-warp civilization? were these barbarians pre-warp? if so, why engage with them at all? does desperation for the vaccine justify interfering with a pre-warp culture?
