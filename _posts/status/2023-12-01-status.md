The good:
* Had a really nice time at Thanksgiving at my parents' in LA. Chase met them for the first time, and everybody seemed to get along well.
* While in LA, Chase and I had breakfast with the oldest of my younger sisters, Jacqueline, from whom I'd been estranged for almost two decades. While it was a bit odd to feel guarded and to be avoiding many elephants in the room, it was pleasant, and it was a good step in the direction of healing our relationship. I'm cautiously optimistic.
* [I finished my cut, though with mixed results.](https://www.facebook.com/ArthurZey/posts/pfbid02osiktHj98XzMFNSeCW7z6QZ1oLakc7zw1bP4mvvo4Uq6J28aJwNbHHHFhGBZTUjKl){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
* Chase continues to enjoy [_The Next Generation_](https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek-the-next-generation){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, even though it's season 1, and it hasn't even hit its stride yet!
* Overall, my health continues to be on an upward trajectory.
* I'm continuing to make progress on my parenthood journey.
* My plants are doing well overall.

The bad:
* I came home from Thanksgiving feeling a bit under the weather. I had a bad headache for several days and a tickle in my throat. (Thankfully, it passed by the middle of the next week.)
* It got too cold in my house while I was gone (my Nest Thermostat is busted), and that wasn't great for my plants.
* The fungus gnat situation with my plants is totally out of control and getting really irritating.
* Max has had some behavioral issues.
* I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed and stressed with everything I need to finish by the end of the year.
* Even though my caloric intake on the bulk I started has ramped up to just under my maintenance range, I've been gaining a lot of weight back. It's not terrible, but it's frustrating, since it's not accompanied by any strength gains or much reduction in fatigue or hunger.
* My 96-year-old grandfather fell and broke his leg in the last week (requiring surgery), and given his declining health, that's worrisome.
* It took 5 hours of my effort for AT&T to port an existing line in from another carrier into my account, despite all the proper unlocking etc on the other carrier's side in advance.

The ugly:
* Despite numerous attempts to clean it with various enzymatic agents and methods, my entryway still smells like a urinal because of Murrby's desire to pee on the floor there.
* I'm super frustrated with numerous issues with a lot of technology in my life:
  * Google Nest Hub / Google Assistant, and their inability to control the correct lights
  * Pixel Watch
  * Pixel Buds Pro
  * Nest Thermostat
  * Google Headlines in Discover (always showing me "news" about murder, war, death, rape, violence, etc, as well as sports for some reason)
  * Fi Collar
  * Intuit Mint
  * just random bugs across tons of apps and websites
