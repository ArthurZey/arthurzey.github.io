I've been remiss in providing relevant status updates here, but today, I closed on a house in Bailey, CO. I'm a homeowner for the very first time. The closing process took 3.5 hours, and it was a frustrating ordeal, with lots of baits and switches in the 11th hour and a lot of creative accounting on the Closing Disclosure. A fuller writeup is forthcoming, but meanwhile, I have to finish packing for the movers this Sunday!
