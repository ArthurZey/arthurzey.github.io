The good:
* I'm succeeding at tricking my plants (tomatoes, jalape√±os, spearmint, chives, onion, basil) into thinking it's a different season than it actually is by keeping my house quite warm and putting a humidifier on them.
* I'm feeling a little bit better with respect to my motivation levels and my suspected [Long COVID](https://www.arthurzey.com/blog/2023-08-17/long-covid-funk/#2023-10-31-update).
* I feel like I have a handle on my never-ending to-do list, and I'm more organized in [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/invite/880a248a.lnx){:target="&lowbar;blank"}.
* I've been doing really well with getting to bed early (often around 20:00) and waking up early (often around 04:30) to get more personal/routine stuff done earlier in the day so that I have more headspace throughout the day to focus on work and other priorities.
* In the last week of my 16-week cut (fat-loss phase), I'm down roughly 35 lbs from 222 lbs after my bulk (muscle-gain phase).
* I got my [new, custom-designed snowboard](https://www.facebook.com/ArthurZey/posts/pfbid0GkFRx8MemSLhu4wAnMZ851Cy9P8M77Mn3bg4de1vgzsUhruXF2rqTu7BfAqEsZTAl){:target="&lowbar;blank"}.
* No new incidences in the last few weeks of Murrby's peeing in the entryway.
* Making progress on deciding on a fertility clinic.
* Really enjoyed watching all of [_Avatar: The Last Airbender_](https://trakt.tv/shows/avatar-the-last-airbender){:target="&lowbar;blank"} with Chase.
* Started Chase on a more-than-900-episode voyage to watch all of _Star Trek_, and so far, he's really enjoying the beginning of [_The Next Generation_](https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek-the-next-generation){:target="&lowbar;blank"}.
* May family and friends in Israel are physically safe for now.
* While Robert Sapolsky's [_Determined_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83817782-determined){:target="&lowbar;blank"} has been somewhat infuriating in many respects, it's also led me to consider a few new angles on the topic of determinism and volition, as well as how to articulate certain ideas more clearly.

The bad:
* Billy (my dog with Adam) died in early October.
* I've resigned myself to the conclusion that Murray is probably dead, but gone for good, in any case.
* My maternal grandmother died in August, and that's brought up a lot of difficult, complex emotions.
* I'm irritable as all fuck, largely magnified by my hanger and caloric deficit.
* I remain nervous about my job security and some worrisome dynamics at work.
* Max and Murrby are largely feeling like a burden right now.
* Relatedly, I haven't been devoting enough time to training Max.
* I haven't yet gotten a canine companion for Max.
* Since starting on Phenobarbital in July and only evidence of one seizure in early September, Murrby has had two epileptic seizures in the last two weeks.
* I'm wrestling with Cigna's discriminatory coverage policies, which wouldn't be such a huge problem if they didn't insist that they weren't discriminating.

The ugly:
* Despite numerous attempts to clean it with various enzymatic agents and methods, my entryway still smells like a urinal because of Murrby's desire to pee on the floor there.
* I'm super frustrated with numerous issues with a lot of technology in my life:
  * Google Nest Hub / Google Assistant, and their inability to control the correct lights
  * Pixel Watch
  * Pixel Buds Pro
  * Nest Thermostat
  * Google Headlines in Discover (always showing me "news" about murder, war, death, rape, violence, etc, as well as sports for some reason)
  * Fi Collar
  * Roomba
  * Anova Sous Vide
  * Intuit Mint
  * Ubiquiti UniFi access points providing poor coverage in Cades' home
  * just random bugs across tons of apps and websites
* I'm disappointed with the quality of much of the cultural discourse (and the individual attitudes and dispositions that people hold) around the recent intensification of conflict in the Middle East. I understand that people are frustrated and angry (and with good reason), and yet it seems that many of their approaches (mostly manifesting a sort of us-themming) often reflect a certain level of hypocrisy and lack of self-awareness. I can see so clearly how it leads to the continuation and intensification of conflict and division, all because it lacks compassion, understanding, and genuine human connection.
