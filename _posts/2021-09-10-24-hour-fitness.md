Topics to cover:

* COVID-19 closure, discontinuation of charges
* emails during this period to sort out separation of account from Adam
* resuming charging me without notice
* inability to log in; advising me to call a customer service line that's closed
* month after month of asking for refunds and account freezes
* escalation to CitiBank, disputing charges
* random charges that don't make sense
