# Summary

In early 2020, 24 Hour Fitness temporarily closed their clubs on account of COVID-19, and to their credit, they correctly stopped charging their customers monthly membership fees. Early on during this closure, Adam and I broke up, and I contacted them to disentangle our memberships and to make sure that his legacy rate of $8.25/month wouldn't be impacted. I got no response. After moving to Denver, with no indication that 24 Hour Fitness would open up anytime soon, I secured gym facilities in the form of my apartment building's gym (a major factor in my selection of residence), which came along with a 17-month lease (through February 2022). Without any proactive communication, 24 Hour Fitness began charging my credit card again, which I only discovered after several months of charges. I immediately contacted them and demanded a refund, explaining the situation and that I would need to freeze my membership. Getting a response from them was like pulling teeth. Meanwhile, I attempted to log into my account on their website, but their login system was utterly broken, with no ability to successfully go through the password reset flow. In the very delayed email responses that I finally started getting from them, they advised me to call a customer support number (for both the membership and login issues), except that their call center was indefinitely closed on account of COVID-19. So my only recourse was to continue to interact with them via email. I had to nag them persistently. Every so often, I would notice that they continued to charge my credit card for a monthly membership fee, and each time, I would demand a refund. I would occasionally threaten escalating to my credit card company (CitiBank), but until August 2021, they had always managed to refund the charge before I had to do that. In August 2021, after many weeks of no response, I disputed the charges with CitiBank. In September 2021, I disputed the regular $36.74 monthly membership charge, as well as some inscrutable additional $49.99 charge a week later for which there was no justification. CitiBank refused the dispute for the $49.99, demanding proof of membership cancellation. Uhh... Well, here's the writeup of the whole chronology.

# Charges
_I include here the last valid charges of $36.74 and $8.25 for me and Adam, respectively, from April 2020, to anchor the chronology._

Topics to cover:

* COVID-19 closure, discontinuation of charges
* emails during this period to sort out separation of account from Adam
* resuming charging me without notice
* inability to log in; advising me to call a customer service line that's closed
* month after month of asking for refunds and account freezes
* escalation to CitiBank, disputing charges
* random charges that don't make sense
