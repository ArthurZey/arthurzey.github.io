# Summary
{:.no_toc}

In early 2020, 24 Hour Fitness temporarily closed their clubs on account of COVID-19, and to their credit, they correctly stopped charging their customers monthly membership fees. Early on during this closure, Adam and I broke up, and I contacted them via email to disentangle our memberships and to make sure that his legacy rate of $8.25/month wouldn't be impacted. I got no response. I attempted to call their customer service number, but their call centers were closed, due to COVID. So my only recourse was to continue emailing. After moving to Denver, with no indication that 24 Hour Fitness would open up anytime soon, I secured gym facilities in the form of my apartment building's gym (a major factor in my selection of residence), which came along with a 17-month lease (through February 2022). Without any proactive communication, 24 Hour Fitness began charging my credit card again, which I only discovered after several months of charges. I immediately contacted them and demanded a refund, explaining the situation and requesting that they freeze my membership. Getting a response from them was like pulling teeth. Meanwhile, I attempted to log into my account on their website, but their login system was utterly broken, with no ability to successfully go through the password reset flow. In the very delayed email responses that I finally started getting from them, they advised me to call a customer support number (for both the membership and login issues), except that their call center was indefinitely closed on account of COVID-19. So I had to continue to interact with them via email. I had to nag them persistently. Every so often, I would notice that they continued to charge my credit card for a monthly membership fee (or some other inscrutable charge), and each time, I would demand a refund. I would occasionally threaten escalating to my credit card company (CitiBank), but until August 2021, they had always managed to refund the charge before I had to do that. In August 2021, after several weeks of no response, I disputed the charges with CitiBank, including the regular $36.74 monthly membership charge, as well as some inscrutable additional $49.99 charge a week later for which there was no justification. (I later found out this was an annual fee they didn't charge in 2020 and didn't notice in 2019, but it was buried in the contract and never mentioned to me orally when I signed up in 2018.) CitiBank refused the dispute for the $49.99, demanding proof of membership cancellation. Uhh... Well, here's the writeup of the whole chronology.


# Key Points
{:.no_toc}

* On [2020-11-04 at 16:02 MDT](#2020-11-04-1602-mdt), I requested "Place a freeze on my membership, so that I can reactivate it at a later date at the same $36.74/month rate.".
* On [2020-12-03 at 15:41 MDT](#2020-12-03-1255-mdt), I again unequivocally requested "I would like the freeze to be in effect until I choose to unfreeze.".
* On [2020-12-09 at 12:05 MDT](#2020-12-09-1205-mdt), my freeze request was confirmed: "We have processed your request to place a temporary freeze on your agreement . During the freeze period, you will not be financially responsible for your monthly dues payment and you will not have access to our facilities. When the requested time has expired, your agreed dues rate will adjust and automatically resume its regularly scheduled payment cycle."\\
Given that this came after my request for "the freeze to be in effect until I choose to unfreeze", this was an implied confirmation of those terms, particularly because my request was not contradicted. Moreover, because [my 12:28 MDT request for clarification on the same email thread on the same day](#2020-12-09-1228-mdt) did not get a response, I had a reasonable expectation that "until I choose to unfreeze" would be honored.
* On [2020-12-17 at 14:25 MDT](#2020-12-17-1425-mdt), after [being advised to call their call center](#2020-12-10-1435-mdt), I told them that I was unable to get through to their call centers because they were closed "until further notice", which meant that I could not communicate with them about either membership management or website bug issues, except by email. It's no surprise that we went through the same ridiculous loop again between [2020-12-23](#2020-12-23-0936-mdt) and [2020-12-24](#2020-12-24-1454-mdt).
* On [2021-04-03 at 05:41 MDT](#2021-04-03-0541-mdt), I had to remind 24 Hour Fitness that my membership was supposed to be frozen. So when I got a confirmation on [2021-04-08 at 12:13 MDT](#2021-04-08-1213-mdt) that my membership was frozen again, but had an erroneous end date of 2021-06-01, I immediately corrected them, with an explanation of the reasons at [12:25 MDT](#2021-04-08-1225-mdt), forbidding them from charging me again. And after they did again on 2021-06-01 and 2021-07-01 (while I continued to email them demanding a refund and threatening escalation to my credit card company), they finally refunded me on [2021-07-08](#2021-07-08-1132-mdt), an implicit acknowledgement that they should not have charged me and that my membership was supposed to have been frozen. 24 Hour Fitness never explicitly replied to my emails about those charges, despite my asking for a response or acknowledgement.

_From me to customerservice@24hourfitness.com; subject "Followup on membership status"_

Hello--

I realize that your customer service department is likely operating at diminished capacity in light of both the COVID-19 pandemic and the Chapter 11 restructuring, so please forgive my persistence after filing a few inquiries through your website last week.

Having just gone through a difficult breakup and trying to disentangle accounts, I'm trying to tie up as many loose ends as possible...and I need to make sure that I have my gym situation sorted out for when club locations near me open up again.

For continuity/convenience, here's what I had submitted:

> I can't log in because your password reset flow is broken. (I reset the password based on the email, then try to log in with that password, and I'm told it's incorrect.) Also, I put in a fake value for your "Club Location" dropdown on this form because you don't have any San Francisco locations.
> So I'm instead sending you this message: I'm trying to understand what the situation is with my membership, since my membership was established under Adam Robers's account with a friends and family deal, and he and I have split up, so he was going to disentangle our accounts. Please let me know. Thank you.

Can you tell me why I'm unable to log in? Is it because my account was cancelled already (perhaps because Adam had contacted you)?

Thank you very much.

_This is all fine and well, but [I was unable to log in](#2020-06-26-1658-pdt) to either manage or cancel my membership, and the phone numbers they directed me to went to call centers with automated messages that said that they were unstaffed and that I had to manage my account online...

_From me to customerservice@24hourfitness.com; subject "Followup on membership status"_

Hello--

After getting no reply from you via email for 4 months and not being able to get a hold of your customer service call center back in June and July, I noted that you had not been charging my credit card for membership since April 3. This is good, since your gyms have been closed.

However, I noted that you started charging me again in October:
* $19.59 on 2020-10-02
* $36.74 on 2020-11-01

This is after receiving _ZERO_ communication from you about gym openings/closures since my last inquiry. I'm not sure if I was just expected to be checking gym openings manually on some regular cadence, or...?

Meanwhile, I've had to make my own fitness arrangements that didn't depend on your gym.

And I also noted that I _still_ cannot log into your website:
[TO DO: REPLACE WITH IMAGE: Screen Shot 2020-11-04 at 15.57.36.172 MST.png]

Therefore, I request the following, please:
1. Reactivate my online account.
2. Refund me $19.59 + $36.74 = $56.33.
3. Place a freeze on my membership, so that I can reactivate it at a later date at the same $36.74/month rate.

Thank you.

## 2020-11-09 11:24 MDT
_From donotreply@24hourfit.com to me; subject "Your 24 Hour Fitness Membership Inquiry"_

_Again, this doesn't address my inquiries, and it directs me to manage my membership through an online portal I cannot log into or to call a phone number that does not connect me with a human._

Dear Member,

Thank you for your email. We are working diligently through our queue and we greatly apologize for any delayed response times. We appreciate your patience and understanding.

Please review the below information to assist with your billing inquiry:

* **Monthly dues billing:**
  * After April 15th, monthly dues billing was placed on hold while clubs were closed. Upon reopening clubs in your area, your membership was reactivated and your monthly dues billing resumed.
  * When dues billing resumed, there was a pro-rated invoice generated which covered **the period between your reactivation date and your next regular monthly dues billing date**. Following that prorated invoice, your first full-monthly dues billing resumed on your regular billing date.
    * _For example:  If your membership was reactivated on June 1 and your normal billing date was June 15, you were billed a prorated amount on June 1st for June 1-14*._\\
    _*Note: If you had a credit for the one (1) month dues credit “thank you” offer (as applicable) that credit would be applied toward your first dues (prorated) invoice, and any remaining credit will be applied toward your first full-monthly dues billing. Visit the Covid-19 section in our FAQ’s for more information on thank you offers._
  * In a small number of cases, due to reopening dates and system timing, the first reactivation invoice and the subsequent 1 or 2 months of full-monthly dues were combined into one billing.
  * As a reminder, 60 days of time will be added to the end of your membership to provide you with access to the clubs for the March and April 2020 billings while our clubs were closed.
* **Prepaid/Limited memberships:**
  * Prepaid, annual renewal memberships were given credit for paid time clubs were closed in your area.   The credit will be applied toward an upcoming membership balance.
  * Limited membership expiration dates were extended to reflect the amount of time clubs were closed in your area.

For information regarding our company restructuring, including requests for refunds for billing prior to June 15, 2020, please visit https://www.24hourfitness.com/restructure, or call (877) 606-3612 (toll free in the U.S. and Canada) or +1 (949) 635-4482 (international).

Once your membership has been reactivated, you will have the option to log into [MyAccount Online](https://www.24hourfitness.com/login.html#/){:target="&lowbar;blank"} to place your membership on an additional one-month freeze with no fees.  If you wish to cancel your membership, **you may expedite your request** by visiting our website by following this [link](https://www.24hourfitness.com/myaccount/membership.html#/cancel){:target="&lowbar;blank"} and follow the instructions to submit your request to cancel.  

We hope that this information has been helpful. If you have additional questions that have not been answered, are requesting a refund, or if you feel that additional time is needed following the one-month freeze, please speak with a team member at your local club.

We hope you and your family remain safe and healthy through these unique times and look forward to continuing to service your fitness needs.

Hello. I'm following up on this again, since I still have not heard back about this matter.

I do not wish to have to contact my credit card company about these charges.

## 2020-11-19 12:41 MDT
_From me to customerservice@24hourfitness.com; subject "Followup on membership status"_

Hello. It's been over a week since the last time I inquired about this.

To remind you: I have no way of managing my membership, since I'm unable to log in, there's no phone number I can call to speak to a representative, and you haven't responded to my emails for over 4 months, despite the autoresponses promising that you'll get to them as soon as possible.

## 2020-11-27 14:34 MDT
_From me to customerservice@24hourfitness.com; subject "Followup on membership status"_

I randomly got a password reset email. I went through the flow to establish a new password. But I still couldn't log in, which is consistent with my previous experience. I suspect the problem is not that there is a wrong password, but that you have deactivated my account.

I've attached a few relevant screenshots.

I still have not heard a reply to my other inquiries, and it's been weeks. Well, months.

Hi there. Thank you for getting back to me.

The correct refund is $56.33, as I documented in my November 4 email, assuming you haven't also charged me again since then.

I still cannot log in, despite following the instructions.

I still haven't gotten a confirmation that you have frozen my account, as I requested in the November 4 email.

Can you issue the remaining $31.27 refund, fix my account access, and confirm the rest of in order?

Thank you again.

We have refunded an additional $36.74 on your membership RY62280.  Your membership is currently on a freeze and will remain on a freeze until clubs in your area allowed to reopen.  To get updates on when clubs will open in your area, please download the 24GO app from the Google Play or Apple app store and turn on notifications.

Thanks,

Thank you. I appreciate that.

I would like the freeze to be in effect until I choose to unfreeze. Also, what area are you considering me in?

And also, I didn't get a password reset email, but the password reset flow is what didn't work before.

I can also try to trigger it myself again.

Thank you again.

Dear  Arthur,

Thank you for your email.  We value you as a member and appreciate the opportunity to service your fitness needs.

We have processed your request to place a temporary freeze on your agreement . During the freeze period, you will not be financially responsible for your monthly dues payment and you will not have access to our facilities.

When the requested time has expired, your agreed dues rate will adjust and automatically resume its regularly scheduled payment cycle.

We have sent a password reset link to your email on file, you can check your spam or your junk mail for the link.

Thank you for your patience while resolving this matter, and I wish you continued success with your fitness goals.

As I keep emailing, the password reset flow isn't working. Please see the other email about that.

What do you mean by "agreed dues rate will adjust"? How does that work? I thought I get the same rate that I originally agreed to.

What is "the requested time"? How long is the freeze period?

_From me to customerservice@24hourfitness.com; subject "Unauthorized charge"_

Hello. I saw a charge on my credit card for $57.99 posted on April 1, which I did not authorize, and without getting any notification from you in advance.

Please refund it immediately.

My account is on pause, and I don't know where the $57.99 number came from, since my monthly fee (when not paused) is ~$35.

If I do not have it refunded by April 15, I will report the transaction as fraudulent with my credit card company, which I really do not want to have to go through.

Thank you.

_From crmwebmail@24hourfit.com to me; subject "General Billing Inquiry"_

Dear Arthur,

Thank you for your email. I apologize for any inconvenience.

However, I see that your Monthly Membership was reactivated from Freeze on **03/21/2021 since the Clubs have reopened during those time, hence your Monthly Billing resumed.**

Your regular Monthly Dues is **$36.74. However, as a Freeze Adjustment, you were also charged a fee of $23.70.** This additional charge was a pro-rated dues intending to cover for the period of **03/12/2021 through 03/31/2021.** No worries though! I have gone ahead and refunded the **$57.99** to your Credit Card ending in **\[REDACTED\]** and you should receive a Confirmation Email to "\[REDACTED\]".

As this is not a "Pay-as-you-go" membership and our method of payment is automatic, you will continue to be billed for membership fees whether or not you use the Club. Once a membership is "Active", automatic withdrawal will occur on the designated Monthly Dues dates.

On that premise, we have taken your request into consideration and I have gone ahead and placed your membership on a 1 month freeze. The freeze will be lifted on **05/08/2021, and the Amount Due on Reactivation Date is $28.44.** Monthly Dues Resumes On: **06/01/2021.**

Hi, Jomeo--

Thank you for getting back to me explicitly and for explaining the amounts.

When I corresponded with your customer service in late 2020, my membership was placed on an indefinite freeze, not until "the Clubs have reopened". Because of the closures, I have had to find an alternative gym solution. I did not authorize (nor was I even apprised in advance) resuming my membership as of March 12. How was I even supposed to know that you had intended to charge me for that or that I could even start using the clubs? If you unfreeze my membership, I should be apprised in advance.

Regardless, a 1-month freeze is insufficient, as I am already under contract with a gym for many more months, so double-paying for a membership I won't use doesn't make sense. Please do not lift the freeze on May 8.

Thank you again.

Hi there-- Checking in on this again.

Thank you.

Hello again. I have not heard from you in over 2 months now.

However, I noticed that you charged me $37.01 on June 1, which I did not authorize (and explicitly forbade!). I still have not been to any club., nor do I anticipate returning in the near future until my alternative membership contract runs out.

Can you please refund that and prevent me from getting charged again until I'm ready to unfreeze?

I hope you'll forgive my frustration, but this is getting seriously tiresome.

Thank you.

Hello, again. It's been a week since my last email. I'm concerned that you will erroneously charge me again on Thursday (July 1), and we're going to be wrestling with yet another refund.

Can you please attend to this matter as soon as possible?

Thank you.

## 2021-07-03 08:31 MDT
_From me to crmwebmail@24hourfit.com; subject "General Billing Inquiry"_

Now please also refund the July 1 charge of $36.74.

I'm hoping I don't need to escalate this to my credit card company.

Thank you.

_From me to crmwebmail@24hourfit.com and customerservice@24hourfitness.com; subject "General Billing Inquiry"_

Hello there. I will be requesting that my credit card company reverse these erroneous charges on Monday, July 12, if I don't hear back from you before then that you are refunding me $37.01 + $36.74 = $73.75.

Thank you.

Thanks again.




# Attempts to Access Online Account
This isn't really that interesting, and it's somewhat tangential to the main issue here, but it illustrates my attempt to manage my own account and that 24 Hour Fitness was unwilling or unable to enable me to do that.

## 2020-06-26 16:48 PDT
I attempted to reset my password to get access to my account. 24 Hour Fitness (no_reply@24hourfit.com) sent me an email ("Online Password Request") to allow me to complete the password reset flow.

## 2020-06-26 16:50 PDT
24 Hour Fitness (no_reply@24hourfit.com) sent me an email ("Your My24 Account password has been reset") to inform me that I can now log in with my new password.

## 2020-06-26 16:58 PDT
After I was still unable to log in, I submitted an inquiry through their website, and I got a stock email from customerservice@24hourfitness.com with some FAQs ("Automatic reply: Forgot User Name/Password"). I referenced my inability to log in in [my followup email on 2020-07-03](#2020-07-03-1226-pdt).

This is getting rather tiresome. We keep going around in circles.

This time, I was able to reset the password and got a confirmation, both on the web and via email. But I still cannot log in with the new credentials. (And I work in technology, so I'm not just being dense about this.)

Here are two different pages offering me error messages:

What's the next step? I think continuously trying to reset my password through the normal flow is unlikely to work. This is now, what, the third time we've tried?

As I speculated before, I think this has something to do with my account status.

What is "Standard Time"?

## 2020-12-17 14:25 MDT
_From me to customerservice@24hourfitness.com; subject "24Hour Fitness"_

Hi, Shanae or whoever can help here--

I'm following up again, another week later.

I don't understand why I'm being instructed to call a phone number for a call center that's closed "until further notice". It's been closed for many months now. Here, I thought maybe you had reopened your call centers, maybe to help with the website bugs. I guess not. So what are we going to do about this? I can't access my account online. And I hasten to reiterate that I'm a technology professional, so I'm not exactly doing something stupid with the password reset flow.

Again, I don't know what "Standard Time" is, but I called within the hours that the automated voice recording said were the hours...and yet it also said they were closed.

To be clear, I'm not asking for my password to be reset. I'm asking for you to reactivate my online account (NOT reactivate my membership), since no amount of password resets and going through that flow seems to work, as I've now documented numerous times. (I remind you that I'm a technology professional, so this is not user error.)

## 2020-12-29 10:29 MDT
Presumably because a 24 Hour Fitness employee triggered the reset flow, 24 Hour Fitness (no_reply@24hourfit.com) sent me an email ("Online Password Request") to allow me to complete the password reset flow.

## 2020-12-29 10:30 MDT
4 Hour Fitness (no_reply@24hourfit.com) sent me an email ("Online Password Request") to allow me to complete the password reset flow, presumably a duplicate email, but I used this newer one's reset link.

## 2020-12-29 10:33 MDT
24 Hour Fitness (no_reply@24hourfit.com) sent me an email ("Your My24 Account password has been reset") to inform me that I can now log in with my new password. I was still unable to log in.
