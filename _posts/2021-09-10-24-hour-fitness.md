# Summary

In early 2020, 24 Hour Fitness temporarily closed their clubs on account of COVID-19, and to their credit, they correctly stopped charging their customers monthly membership fees. Early on during this closure, Adam and I broke up, and I contacted them to disentangle our memberships and to make sure that his legacy rate of $8.25/month wouldn't be impacted. I got no response. After moving to Denver, with no indication that 24 Hour Fitness would open up anytime soon, I secured gym facilities in the form of my apartment building's gym (a major factor in my selection of residence), which came along with a 17-month lease (through February 2022). Without any proactive communication, 24 Hour Fitness began charging my credit card again, which I only discovered after several months of charges. I immediately contacted them and demanded a refund, explaining the situation and requesting that they freeze my membership. Getting a response from them was like pulling teeth. Meanwhile, I attempted to log into my account on their website, but their login system was utterly broken, with no ability to successfully go through the password reset flow. In the very delayed email responses that I finally started getting from them, they advised me to call a customer support number (for both the membership and login issues), except that their call center was indefinitely closed on account of COVID-19. So my only recourse was to continue to interact with them via email. I had to nag them persistently. Every so often, I would notice that they continued to charge my credit card for a monthly membership fee (or some other inscrutable charge), and each time, I would demand a refund. I would occasionally threaten escalating to my credit card company (CitiBank), but until August 2021, they had always managed to refund the charge before I had to do that. In August 2021, after several weeks of no response, I disputed the charges with CitiBank, including the regular $36.74 monthly membership charge, as well as some inscrutable additional $49.99 charge a week later for which there was no justification. (I later found out this was an annual fee they didn't charge in 2020 and didn't notice in 2019, but it was buried in the contract and never mentioned to me orally when I signed up in 2018.) CitiBank refused the dispute for the $49.99, demanding proof of membership cancellation. Uhh... Well, here's the writeup of the whole chronology.

Topics to cover:

* COVID-19 closure, discontinuation of charges
* emails during this period to sort out separation of account from Adam
* resuming charging me without notice
* inability to log in; advising me to call a customer service line that's closed
* month after month of asking for refunds and account freezes
* escalation to CitiBank, disputing charges
* random charges that don't make sense

Hello--

I realize that your customer service department is likely operating at diminished capacity in light of both the COVID-19 pandemic and the Chapter 11 restructuring, so please forgive my persistence after filing a few inquiries through your website last week.

Having just gone through a difficult breakup and trying to disentangle accounts, I'm trying to tie up as many loose ends as possible...and I need to make sure that I have my gym situation sorted out for when club locations near me open up again.

For continuity/convenience, here's what I had submitted:

> I can't log in because your password reset flow is broken. (I reset the password based on the email, then try to log in with that password, and I'm told it's incorrect.) Also, I put in a fake value for your "Club Location" dropdown on this form because you don't have any San Francisco locations.
> So I'm instead sending you this message: I'm trying to understand what the situation is with my membership, since my membership was established under Adam Robers's account with a friends and family deal, and he and I have split up, so he was going to disentangle our accounts. Please let me know. Thank you.

Can you tell me why I'm unable to log in? Is it because my account was cancelled already (perhaps because Adam had contacted you)?

Thank you very much.

_This is all fine and well, but [I was unable to log in](#2020-06-26-1658-pdt) to either manage or cancel my membership, and the phone numbers they directed me to went to call centers with automated messages that said that they were unstaffed and that I had to manage my account online... No chance of speaking to a live human..._

_From me to customerservice@24hourfitness.com; subject "Followup on membership status"_

Hello--

After getting no reply from you via email for 4 months and not being able to get a hold of your customer service call center back in June and July, I noted that you had not been charging my credit card for membership since April 3. This is good, since your gyms have been closed.

However, I noted that you started charging me again in October:
* $19.59 on 2020-10-02
* $36.74 on 2020-11-01

This is after receiving _ZERO_ communication from you about gym openings/closures since my last inquiry. I'm not sure if I was just expected to be checking gym openings manually on some regular cadence, or...?

Meanwhile, I've had to make my own fitness arrangements that didn't depend on your gym.

And I also noted that I _still_ cannot log into your website:
[TO DO: REPLACE WITH IMAGE: Screen Shot 2020-11-04 at 15.57.36.172 MST.png]

Therefore, I request the following, please:
1. Reactivate my online account.
2. Refund me $19.59 + $36.74 = $56.33.
3. Place a freeze on my membership, so that I can reactivate it at a later date at the same $36.74/month rate.

Thank you.

_From donotreply@24hourfit.com to me; subject "Your 24 Hour Fitness Membership Inquiry"_

_Again, this doesn't address my inquiries, and it directs me to manage my membership through an online portal I cannot log into or to call a phone number that does not connect me with a human._

Dear Member,

Thank you for your email. We are working diligently through our queue and we greatly apologize for any delayed response times. We appreciate your patience and understanding.

Please review the below information to assist with your billing inquiry:

* **Monthly dues billing:**
  * After April 15th, monthly dues billing was placed on hold while clubs were closed. Upon reopening clubs in your area, your membership was reactivated and your monthly dues billing resumed.
  * When dues billing resumed, there was a pro-rated invoice generated which covered **the period between your reactivation date and your next regular monthly dues billing date**. Following that prorated invoice, your first full-monthly dues billing resumed on your regular billing date.
    * _For example:  If your membership was reactivated on June 1 and your normal billing date was June 15, you were billed a prorated amount on June 1st for June 1-14*._\\
    _*Note: If you had a credit for the one (1) month dues credit “thank you” offer (as applicable) that credit would be applied toward your first dues (prorated) invoice, and any remaining credit will be applied toward your first full-monthly dues billing. Visit the Covid-19 section in our FAQ’s for more information on thank you offers._
  * In a small number of cases, due to reopening dates and system timing, the first reactivation invoice and the subsequent 1 or 2 months of full-monthly dues were combined into one billing.
  * As a reminder, 60 days of time will be added to the end of your membership to provide you with access to the clubs for the March and April 2020 billings while our clubs were closed.
* **Prepaid/Limited memberships:**
  * Prepaid, annual renewal memberships were given credit for paid time clubs were closed in your area.   The credit will be applied toward an upcoming membership balance.
  * Limited membership expiration dates were extended to reflect the amount of time clubs were closed in your area.

For information regarding our company restructuring, including requests for refunds for billing prior to June 15, 2020, please visit https://www.24hourfitness.com/restructure, or call (877) 606-3612 (toll free in the U.S. and Canada) or +1 (949) 635-4482 (international).

Once your membership has been reactivated, you will have the option to log into [MyAccount Online](https://www.24hourfitness.com/login.html#/){:target="&lowbar;blank"} to place your membership on an additional one-month freeze with no fees.  If you wish to cancel your membership, **you may expedite your request** by visiting our website by following this [link](https://www.24hourfitness.com/myaccount/membership.html#/cancel){:target="&lowbar;blank"} and follow the instructions to submit your request to cancel.  

We hope that this information has been helpful. If you have additional questions that have not been answered, are requesting a refund, or if you feel that additional time is needed following the one-month freeze, please speak with a team member at your local club.

We hope you and your family remain safe and healthy through these unique times and look forward to continuing to service your fitness needs.

_From me to customerservice@24hourfitness.com; subject "Followup on membership status"_

Hello. I'm following up on this again, since I still have not heard back about this matter.

I do not wish to have to contact my credit card company about these charges.

## 2020-11-19 12:41 MDT
_From me to customerservice@24hourfitness.com; subject "Followup on membership status"_

Hello. It's been over a week since the last time I inquired about this.

To remind you: I have no way of managing my membership, since I'm unable to log in, there's no phone number I can call to speak to a representative, and you haven't responded to my emails for over 4 months, despite the autoresponses promising that you'll get to them as soon as possible.

## 2020-11-27 14:34 MDT
_From me to customerservice@24hourfitness.com; subject "Followup on membership status"_

I randomly got a password reset email. I went through the flow to establish a new password. But I still couldn't log in, which is consistent with my previous experience. I suspect the problem is not that there is a wrong password, but that you have deactivated my account.

I've attached a few relevant screenshots.

I still have not heard a reply to my other inquiries, and it's been weeks. Well, months.

[TO DO: INCLUDE SCREENSHOTS]

# Attempts to Access Online Account
This isn't really that interesting, and it's somewhat tangential to the main issue here, but it illustrates my attempt to manage my own account and that 24 Hour Fitness was unwilling or unable to enable me to do that.

## 2020-06-26 16:48 PDT
I attempted to reset my password to get access to my account. 24 Hour Fitness (no_reply224hourfit.com) sent me an email ("Online Password Request") to allow me to complete the password reset flow.

## 2020-06-26 16:50 PDT
24 Hour Fitness (no_reply224hourfit.com) sent me an email ("Your My24 Account password has been reset") to inform me that I can now log in with my new password.

## 2020-06-26 16:58 PDT
After I was still unable to log in, I submitted an inquiry through their website, and I got a stock email from customerservice@24hourfitness.com with some FAQs ("Automatic reply: Forgot User Name/Password"). I referenced my inability to log in in [my followup email on 2020-07-03](#2020-07-03-1226-pdt).

## 2020-11-27 14:30 MDT
I again attempted to reset my password to get access to my account. 24 Hour Fitness (no_reply224hourfit.com) sent me an email ("Online Password Request") to allow me to complete the password reset flow.

## 2020-11-27 14:32 MDT
24 Hour Fitness (no_reply224hourfit.com) sent me an email ("Your My24 Account password has been reset") to inform me that I can now log in with my new password. I was still unable to log in, which I reported in [my followup email a few minutes later](#2020-11-27-1434-mdt).
