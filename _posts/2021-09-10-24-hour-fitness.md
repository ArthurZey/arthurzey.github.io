# Summary

In early 2020, 24 Hour Fitness temporarily closed their clubs on account of COVID-19, and to their credit, they correctly stopped charging their customers monthly membership fees. Early on during this closure, Adam and I broke up, and I contacted them to disentangle our memberships and to make sure that his legacy rate of $8.25/month wouldn't be impacted. I got no response. After moving to Denver, with no indication that 24 Hour Fitness would open up anytime soon, I secured gym facilities in the form of my apartment building's gym (a major factor in my selection of residence), which came along with a 17-month lease (through February 2022). Without any proactive communication, 24 Hour Fitness began charging my credit card again, which I only discovered after several months of charges. I immediately contacted them and demanded a refund, explaining the situation and requesting that they freeze my membership. Getting a response from them was like pulling teeth. Meanwhile, I attempted to log into my account on their website, but their login system was utterly broken, with no ability to successfully go through the password reset flow. In the very delayed email responses that I finally started getting from them, they advised me to call a customer support number (for both the membership and login issues), except that their call center was indefinitely closed on account of COVID-19. So my only recourse was to continue to interact with them via email. I had to nag them persistently. Every so often, I would notice that they continued to charge my credit card for a monthly membership fee (or some other inscrutable charge), and each time, I would demand a refund. I would occasionally threaten escalating to my credit card company (CitiBank), but until August 2021, they had always managed to refund the charge before I had to do that. In August 2021, after several weeks of no response, I disputed the charges with CitiBank, including the regular $36.74 monthly membership charge, as well as some inscrutable additional $49.99 charge a week later for which there was no justification. (I later found out this was an annual fee they didn't charge in 2020 and didn't notice in 2019, but it was buried in the contract and never mentioned to me orally when I signed up in 2018.) CitiBank refused the dispute for the $49.99, demanding proof of membership cancellation. Uhh... Well, here's the writeup of the whole chronology.

# Charges
_To anchor the chronology, I include here the last valid charges from April 2020 of $36.74 and $8.25 for me and Adam, respectively._

Topics to cover:

* COVID-19 closure, discontinuation of charges
* emails during this period to sort out separation of account from Adam
* resuming charging me without notice
* inability to log in; advising me to call a customer service line that's closed
* month after month of asking for refunds and account freezes
* escalation to CitiBank, disputing charges
* random charges that don't make sense

Hello--

I realize that your customer service department is likely operating at diminished capacity in light of both the COVID-19 pandemic and the Chapter 11 restructuring, so please forgive my persistence after filing a few inquiries through your website last week.

Having just gone through a difficult breakup and trying to disentangle accounts, I'm trying to tie up as many loose ends as possible...and I need to make sure that I have my gym situation sorted out for when club locations near me open up again.

For continuity/convenience, here's what I had submitted:

> I can't log in because your password reset flow is broken. (I reset the password based on the email, then try to log in with that password, and I'm told it's incorrect.) Also, I put in a fake value for your "Club Location" dropdown on this form because you don't have any San Francisco locations.
> So I'm instead sending you this message: I'm trying to understand what the situation is with my membership, since my membership was established under Adam Robers's account with a friends and family deal, and he and I have split up, so he was going to disentangle our accounts. Please let me know. Thank you.

Can you tell me why I'm unable to log in? Is it because my account was cancelled already (perhaps because Adam had contacted you)?

Thank you very much.

Hello--

After getting no reply from you via email for 4 months and not being able to get a hold of your customer service call center back in June and July, I noted that you had not been charging my credit card for membership since April 3. This is good, since your gyms have been closed.

However, I noted that you started charging me again in October:
* $19.59 on 2020-10-02
* $36.74 on 2020-11-01

This is after receiving _ZERO_ communication from you about gym openings/closures since my last inquiry. I'm not sure if I was just expected to be checking gym openings manually on some regular cadence, or...?

Meanwhile, I've had to make my own fitness arrangements that didn't depend on your gym.

And I also noted that I _still_ cannot log into your website:

Therefore, I request the following, please:
1. Reactivate my online account.
2. Refund me $19.59 + $36.74 = $56.33.
3. Place a freeze on my membership, so that I can reactivate it at a later date at the same $36.74/month rate.

Thank you.

Hello. I'm following up on this again, since I still have not heard back about this matter.

I do not wish to have to contact my credit card company about these charges.

_From me to customerservice@24hourfitness.com; subject "Followup on membership status"_

Hello. It's been over a week since the last time I inquired about this.

To remind you: I have no way of managing my membership, since I'm unable to log in, there's no phone number I can call to speak to a representative, and you haven't responded to my emails for over 4 months, despite the autoresponses promising that you'll get to them as soon as possible.

I randomly got a password reset email. I went through the flow to establish a new password. But I still couldn't log in, which is consistent with my previous experience. I suspect the problem is not that there is a wrong password, but that you have deactivated my account.

I've attached a few relevant screenshots.

I still have not heard a reply to my other inquiries, and it's been weeks. Well, months.
