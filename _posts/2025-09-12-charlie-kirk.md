Last night, I was listening to Chopin's Nocturne No 2 in E-Flat Major, Opus 9 No 2:

<iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/41jwqis6FPDjSKvP80zGtr?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

It was while I was getting ready for bed, and for two days now, "current events" in the world had been weighing on me heavily. I was struck by the stark contrast between the beauty that humanity is capable of producing and the tragedy of recent days. That humanity is a "savage child race" is constantly on my mind.

I cried. And then I tossed and turned, unable to fall asleep for what seemed like hours.

## An Unlikely Blog Post

I do my best to stay away from politics, "current events", and, as I often derisively refer to it, the drama du jour. Indeed, I have quipped, only somewhat tongue-in-cheek, that [The Prime Directive](/prime-directive/) prohibits my interference, and because I cannot do anything about these events anyway, nor can I arrange my own personal affairs any differently on the basis of being informed about them, it's a poor use of my time and efforts to even be informed. I've done a pretty good job of tweaking and cultivating my Facebook feed (the only social media I regularly consume) to reflect those preferences, and so typically, I'm confronted by posts about babies, pets, vacations, job changes, fitness progress, and food.

But I could not avoid the news about Charlie Kirk, someone whom I'd never heard of before (or if I did, I didn't bother to remember). Perhaps it was morbid curiosity, but I read a lot of posts and comments, from those on the right (whom I'll interchangeably also call "conservatives", without trying to be precise with that terminology), those on the left (whom I'll _never_ grace with the utterly inappropriate moniker "liberal"), and those who are more Objectivist- or libertarian-leaning.

What I read was heartbreaking. I literally feel a knot in my chest, reflecting a profound distress about the state of our culture.

And it is not about the superficial reasons that ideological disagreements are being "resolved" through violence, what that reflects, or what the likely consequences of that will be--those would be bad enough, but that's all a tale as old as time.

No, it's something deeper: It's the various ways that people are _reacting_ to this.

By all rights, I should have written something up when Brian Thompson was murdered at the end of 2024--the reactions to that were similarly disappointing. But somehow, this is hitting me harder. Or maybe it's the accumulation of both events in less than a year. I don't know.

But here goes.

## Murder and Wrongness

First, I want to set some important philosophical context:

_Murder is wrong. Full stop._

No qualifications. No provisos. No hedging. No explanations.

No "Murder is wrong, but...".

Murder is an _unjustified killing_. That "unjustified" part is what makes it wrong, and it makes "Murder is wrong." effectively a tautology. There are no murders that are right. There's no such thing as "It's immoral, but it's the right thing to do.". And this isn't playing at semantics or word games--this has to do with what these concepts actually _mean_.

If you have properly formed and grasped the concepts of right and wrong, of killing versus murder, of force and [individual rights](https://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, and of the principle that people's _genuine_ interests are harmonious, there is no temptation to think that a murder--any murder--can possibly be a net benefit. Whatever positive externalities there might be from an immoral act, its being immoral captures that it's a net loss _for everybody_.

So we must take seriously that when we say that something is wrong, that we condemn it wholesale, without hand-wringing or excuses.

To be sure, not all immoral acts deserve the same intensity or degree of condemnation, but murder is up there. And it's not some mere coincidence that our general extreme revulsion to murder is commensurate with the extreme practical consequences of murder, both in the immediate term (the individual life that's been extinguished and the people that affects) and in the long term (what behaviors are thereby normalized or encouraged in a society).

So let me bring these abstractions to the present context:

_I unequivocally condemn Charlie Kirk's murder._

It doesn't matter whether I agree or disagree with him on this or that. It doesn't matter whether he was saying true things or vile falsehoods. It doesn't matter if he was a powerful ideological force in the culture for good or for ill. I'm not going to entertain the desire to dilute the condemnation (or engage in some kind of "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it." virtue signaling) by saying that I don't agree with him on some issues. That is _so_ beside the point. (And really, if you know me at all, that I am a defender of individual rights and capitalism, then you should already know where I stand on the issues of immigration, abortion, gays, trans folks, freedom of speech, debate versus violence, and every other issue on which Charlie Kirk may have expressed an opinion.)

If you read that someone condemns his murder and doesn't follow up with a sort of defensive "But I disagree with him about _x_, _y_, and _z_!", and you conclude that that person thereby sanctions the substance of everything that Charlie Kirk said...well, all I can say is that that is not very clear thinking, and it's jumping to unfounded and, more importantly, _irrelevant_ conclusions. It says more about _you_ and where your focus is: Us-Themming is more important to you than whether murder is being used to oppose ideas you find repugnant (and all the consequences of living in a society where that is normalized).

If you are the person who condemns his murder and _does_ follow up with that defense, I get it. Really, I can relate to why you're doing it. But I think that ultimately does the overall discussion a disservice, conceding that what Charlie Kirk said and whether you agree with it has any relevance whatsoever.

There is a lot more I want to say about the philosophical dimension of this, addressing some of the dynamics on a social/cultural/political level, but I will save that until later.

## People Are Doing the Best That They Can

There's a second bit of context that needs to be set, and it's sort of a blend of philosophical and psychological observations. I have stood on the shoulders of many giants to reach these convictions, but on this specific point, Brené Brown was the chief catalyst for my thinking and development.

_I believe that people are basically good, that they are generally and genuinely doing the best that they can, with the skills and capacities that they have at any given time._

This is controversial, and really, it requires no less than a full treatise on its own, not the least of which to explore what I mean by "doing the best that they can". But I can't do that here, so please be charitable and fill in some blanks for yourself, reflecting on your own experience: Yes, there are some ways in which you think you might have been able to do better, but when you didn't, think about how that reflected the best you could do, given your resources (emotional, intellectual, etc) at the moment. Moreover, I want to emphasize that this "theory" is derived from and for application to real people and real relationships in life, not remote celebrities, characters or caricatures, or abstract hypotheticals.

So much of our art (stories, literature, mythology, plays, TV, movies, and even paintings) for millennia has perpetuated the melodrama of "good versus evil", cashing in on and reinforcing a natural human bias toward the cognitive efficiency of quick moralizing: If you do a bad thing, you're evil, and then I can write you off and dehumanize you.

In reality, I think there are very few genuinely "bad guys", and it's really people doing the best they can. Sometimes, based on adopting bad values and destructive ideas, people are seduced into doing terrible, terrible things--and in the long run, they hurt themselves as they go about hurting others. They are trying to achieve what they think is some kind of value (or avoid some punishment or pain), but they are either mistaken about whether it's a genuine life-enhancing value, or they pursue it via irrational (destructive) means. I'm really serious here: On some level, people who do even the worst things often believe (albeit mistakenly) that they are justified in what they're doing. And think to yourself: Surely you have at least once in your life done a thing you now realize is wrong, but in the moment, you really thought what you were doing was justified. I know I have. And would you consider yourself evil? Of course not--and remember, nobody is the villain of their own story.

None of this excuses their beliefs, choices, or actions, let alone the destructive consequences. But if you grasp the motives, if you understand where they're coming from, if you can identify with their temptations (even if you know you would do something different in their place), if you can adopt a sort of "There but for the grade of God go I." mindset (which I say as an atheist!), you can hold people accountable with love in your heart: "I know you were doing the best that you could, but it was unacceptable, and now I have to...".

Even though this is so much more difficult than just condemning someone as evil, not only does this improve your own experience of bad behavior (because your dominant emotional experience tends more toward compassion than anger), it also allows you to more effectively deal with others' bad behavior and encourage better behavior. At the end of the day, people who do bad things, criminals, and the rest--they're not the caricature of "doing evil for evil's sake" that millennia of art has conditioned us to believe, and so by adopting a more growth-mindset (rather than fixed-mindset) approach, we can encourage the best in people while we make sure to hold them accountable for their missteps.

It is difficult, and it requires tremendous discipline, but it is definitely better. I can at least attest that my own life and relationships have dramatically improved since I adopted such an approach.

So if you can take on this way of understanding and relating to other people and their behavior, when they err (_especially_ when they err grievously), your heart _must_ ache when you imagine the challenges that they have gone through and how they sometimes lead them to doing some very bad things. It's tragic.

But I want to put this very starkly: I don't think I've ever actually met someone whom I'd characterize as evil, and I have met some people who habitually and dispositionally do some terrible, destructive, hurtful, evil things based on some really horrible ideas. These people need to be held accountable for their ideas, choices, and actions, but to characterize _them_ as evil is worse than lazy; it's ineffective and self-destructive.

I am no stranger to the feeling of angry, righteous indignation in response to injustice and the willfully destructive actions of others, but reacting to that with my own hatred is emotionally corrosive in the long run (really, it's such an unpleasant way to be), no matter how good it might feel in the moment to condemn them as evil and lash out accordingly. Here's the problem: It's dehumanizing, and by keeping yourself in a hate-fueled state of limbic system hijack, you actively undermine your ability to engage your rational faculties to see the situation clearly and find effective solutions that work in the long term. When you write someone off as evil, you no longer examine motives and incentives, you arrest your thinking as it relates to figuring out how to get better behavior from them, and you tempt yourself into escalating a vicious cycle of unpleasantness and bad behavior. Sometimes, you don't need to examine their motives or change their behavior, and you just need to distance yourself from them and their harmful effects, but even then, think about how much better your own experience of that will be if you can part ways with love in your heart, rather than continuing to carry the burden of your ill feelings toward them.

To be clear--this is not some convenient lie that's just superficially useful, that all people are basically good, but they just sometimes make bad choices. I think this is profoundly true. It's a difficult truth to accept, because some people have hurt us quite badly, and we see stories in the news of people doing horrific things. But I think that being armed with this truth is the only way that we can deal with people's bad behaviors in a way that, first and foremost, serves our own interests. Reflect on your own experiences, and really, consider them honestly and carefully: When you have been able to find common ground with someone you might otherwise have considered an enemy, when you've taken the time to understand why they did a bad thing and then explain to them why you find it unacceptable with kindness and compassion (and I think in-person examples illustrate this better), how much better has that been than the sort of vitriolic, antagonistic, condemnatory, accusation-slinging, angry interactions that you've had? Which has been more effective, both in terms of getting the concrete results you want and how much better your experience of it all was? (And, of course, which takes more work?)

I'm paraphrasing here, but Brené Brown has framed this with language I find very helpful: "Shame talk" is when you criticize a person for being bad, that they should feel shame for being who they are, whereas "guilt talk" is when you criticize their behavior, that they should feel guilt over their bad actions because they're a basically good person who has the capacity to understand their wrongdoing and feel bad about it (and hopefully, rectify their errors). I don't think that shame talk is effective, not with children, not with our friends, not with our coworkers, not with internet strangers, and certainly not with our ideological opponents. Even the use of guilt talk needs to be approached quite carefully, but it's directionally correct.

(Side note: We have to take a few categories of people off the table here. We are not talking about people who are extremely mentally ill, such as those whose volitional capacities are impaired or who have neurological handicaps like sociopathy. Also, critically, I want to set aside figures like Hitler, who's everybody's favorite go-to example of evil incarnate. I have a lot more to say about that; I don't think my "theory" here fails to account for the likes of Hitler, but it's far outside the scope of what we can deal with in this post.)

Indeed, I wish I could give this topic more robust treatment here, but you'll just have to stay tuned.

So, with all that out of the way, it's time for a pop quiz: Was I talking about Charlie Kirk or his murderer?

The answer is "Yes", but we'll get to that soon, I promise.

It's time to (finally!) turn our focus on what I think is a much more urgent and deeper issue--and one that maybe is even _more_ provocative.

## The Tragedy of Killing

Sometimes, killing is not murder: It is justified; ie, it is necessary, it is the right thing to do, ultimately, it is _good_.

Say what you will about some of the harmful effects that Charlie Kirk's ideas and their promotion in the culture have had. Because he was expressing ideas and only _advocating_ for certain policies, his behavior does not rise to the level of actually orchestrating the violation of or directly violating individual rights. We can dissect how this differs from the acts of politicians who actually are in the proximate chain of rights violations or from the behavior of a mugger on the street, but this is beside the point. Suffice it to say, Charlie Kirk was no more a rights violator through his speech than a university professor is in advocating for communism. We don't get to kill university professors for advocating their murderous views, however much we know how harmful they are. So we can just dispense with any notion that Charlie Kirk's killing was at all justified--it was straight-up murder.

I want to untangle one more nuance first, though: Without dealing with some marginal issues (eg, assisted suicide), what makes a killing potentially justified is that it is the use of retaliatory force, typically directly against its initiator. But strictly speaking, this is only what makes a killing permissible or "on the table" when it comes to an analysis of individual rights. There are myriad reasons that a particular killing may be a terrible idea. Let's use a relatively simple example, and set aside the law for the moment--I mean only to deal with the principle of individual rights, morality generally, and their requirements, not current legal implementation: A mugger on the street comes at you, wielding a knife. He's getting close, and you genuinely fear for your life. But you have a gun. I think that killing him is morally on the table--from the perspective of individual rights. But if you have the time (and this is a big "if"), you may also be able to neutralize the threat by attempting to incapacitate him, say, by shooting him in the leg. If you have a _safe_ (this is the key), non-lethal means at your disposal to neutralize or eliminate a threat or violation of your rights, I think morality demands that you _not_ kill the mugger, no matter how much lethal retaliatory force may generally be permissible in response to its initiation.

There's so much more that can be explored on this topic, but I'll say that it's a reflection of a more abstract principle when it comes to retaliatory force generally. A drunk asshole at a bar who tries to pick a fight with you and actually pushes you with a clear intent to continue violence _can_ be met with a swift punch to the mouth by his would-be victim, and many would say that that's justified (again, through only the narrow lens of individual rights), but that might actually be dangerous to the would-be victim...especially if one has the skills, surely attempting deescalation tactics might be a more prudent, safer, _and therefore moral_ option.

I'm getting a bit off track by trying to provide more context, so here is my controversial claim: Even justified killings, which I've characterized as "good", are tragic.

If you take seriously what I said about how [people are doing the best that they can](#people-are-doing-the-best-that-they-can), it is similarly tragic when they go down a dark path of committing destructive acts as when the only way to stop them is by extinguishing them. Sometimes, the only way to stop a person from continuing to wreak havoc is to end their life, and this is typically when the person is actively or imminently engaged in violating people's rights, and there's no other way to stop them.

This is a tragedy.

It is horrifically sad that sometimes, the best thing we can do is kill someone, that we've run out of peaceful options, that we can no longer engage with this person's mind, that there's no hope for rehabilitation.

Yes, yes, by initiating force, the person has renounced the principle of dealing with others by reason, and so the only option left is to deal with them by force. But really, that's not always true--we often respond to relatively minor rights violations without retaliatory coercion, instead trying to reach them with words and ideas, and we get adequate (and often superior) resolutions. And so when that is impossible, we should be using retaliatory force with heavy hearts.

Even as recently as a decade ago, I think if you asked me what my reaction would be if some horrible politician were assassinated or some person who had seriously wronged me were killed (or just dropped dead), I'm embarrassed to say that it would have been glee mixed with a hateful, righteous anger--and we're talking about people who are actually rights-violators, who have used force to harm me and people I love. After all, now they can't go about violating anybody else's rights--that's good, and we should celebrate the good. In cases like an assassinated "evil" politician, I rationalized this to myself as "This is a justified killing because it's retaliatory force, and the only crime here is a failure of delegating that retaliatory force to an objective legal system.". That last part is important, but we'll get to that later. Suffice it to say, I found that this approach did not serve me. I'd be willing to bet this approach would not serve anybody, but people need to figure things out for themselves on their own timelines. My point here is that I understand firsthand the allure of righteous vengeance, even on a purely emotional level divorced from taking any affirmative action myself, and I categorically reject it.

So why am I bringing all this up? I'm saying that even for justified killings, we should mourn the death and that the situation was so bad and severe that it had to come to that. I'm arguing against taking pleasure in the death of murderers, even. I'm arguing against "But I'm not sorry he's dead.".

Charlie Kirk's killing was a murder. It was not justified. So it is especially heartbreaking to see the immense volume of people expressing sentiments along the lines of "Yeah, I mean, I don't condone murdering him, but given his views on _x_ and all the activism he did in advance of that cause, I can't be too upset he's gone; the world is better off without him.". There is so much wrong with that statement (some of which I'll get to later), but the thing I find so troubling is this callous indifference to a human life, a person who was doing his best and _peacefully_ arguing for what he believed. Given my argument above, it would be bad enough to hold such an attitude if Charlie Kirk were actually going about violating people's rights and then was (extrajudicially) killed, but when he was straight-up murdered? Oof.

And then a lot of people have also been making comments about his wife and children, like _they_ deserve our compassion, but he doesn't, because of the views he supported. Well, guess what--His wife supported him and thereby also supported the same views and their promulgation.

To my knowledge, Charlie Kirk did not take any coercive action against anybody, however much he may have argued for it--he was causally removed from that initiation of force in a critical way. But some people believe that is justification for killing him, and a great many more believe that that justifies not being sorry he's dead. You can't have it both ways: In principle, if not degree, his wife is just as culpable as he is, and if Charlie Kirk deserves either death or withholding of sorrow, so does his wife.

And his kids? Well surely they're better off without a monster of a father...I mean, imagine if one of them turned out to be trans.

The consistent application and logical result of this attitude toward people we don't like, so much so that we might be a little glad they're dead, leads to some really ugly conclusions.

So now let me be explicitly consistent about my own viewpoint here: As I said, I can relate to and remember the very same feeling that all these people are having, so perhaps obviously, I don't think they're evil. But if you only condemn the murder intellectually, and emotionally, you feel anything other than sadness (or even if you feel neutral about it), I think it calls for some deep introspection and reflection. I don't know how to say that without sounding condescending and holier-than-thou, like, here I've grown and healed and matured and am so wise, and now I'm telling you what you need to do. No, that's not the vibe I'm trying to send out, but like I said, it breaks my heart that in our culture, and among so many people that I know and am even close to, this attitude is so common.

Every death is a tragedy. Every time killing is the only way to deal with someone doing evil deeds, when it's justified, it's still a tragedy that it's come to that. So when it's the _murder_ of someone innocent of any rights violations, we should all be grieving. Full stop.

## The Murderer
At the time that I'm writing this, I'm not aware that the murderer has been positively identified, but that's beside the point.

Let's assume, for the purposes of what follows, that this was a leftist who found Charlie Kirk's viewpoints detestable, dangerous, heinously evil. And let's assume that the murderer's volitional power was not impaired. (I think these are fair guesses, but if my assumptions are wildly off, then at the very worst, this section just reinforces an important point by using a counterfactual--but realistic--hypothetical.)

The murderer holds views that _I_ find detestable. Set aside all the typical leftist ideas I disagree with, this is a person who evidently believes that if a person advocates for bad ideas too vociferously or effectively, it's acceptable to kill them.

I cannot overstate how much that viewpoint is anathema to the core of my being. I see too clearly the consequences of engaging with other people in this way. I know in my bones that individual rights are sacrosanct and that the initiation of force is so, so wrong.

And yet...if I abstract away the substance and the context, I can understand the feeling that I imagine the murderer was acting on. I know what it's like to listen to people voice viewpoints that, if put into practice, would hurt me and people I love. I know the anger that can generate, especially when I imagine that it's hatred and bigotry that's fueling their ideas. As someone who has a strong emotional response to injustice, I get the feeling of righteous fervor, and I definitely understand wanting to do something about it.

But I have the advantage of a rational philosophy that I've also largely subconsciously integrated. I have the advantage of having the skills to calibrate my emotions and intellectual convictions. I have the advantage of knowing how to channel my emotional intensity into productive action. I have the advantage of knowing how to arrest a limbic system hijack.

The murderer obviously had few, if any, of these advantages. That's certainly not an excuse, but by putting it in this kind of perspective, I can relate to and even empathize with the horrific distress the murderer must have felt, a distress that led to the commission of a horrible crime.

I've been calling a lot of things tragedies, and we need to add one more to the list: It's a tragedy that this person felt so helpless and so despondent and desperate, that the only option that seemed available was murder. You may think this is compassion and empathy run amok (heck, I hear that Charlie Kirk himself might have thought so), and in today's culture, that's an understandable reaction, but I want you to think, really think and try to _feel_ what it might be like to be this murderer. Think about what kind of life that must be, what kind of persistent state of dread you would be enduring, what it's like to have every waking moment dominated by a seething hatred that's nothing more than a lashing out from feeling helpless and defensive, like a cornered animal. It is a miserable existence. And what makes it all the worse is your knowledge as you actually at this moment that it's utterly unnecessary. Pity is an ugly emotion, and that's not what I'm counseling--I'm asking how you can not feel a deep sadness in your heart that a human being lived this way, if you can even really call that "living".

There are many conservatives (and even Objectivists) who fervently call for the murderer to be found and convicted (and I'm sure many would want the death penalty), but it's being done with vengeance in their hearts. Notice the dehumanizing rhetoric, that the murderer was an animal or otherwise subhuman filth, scum, etc. It may be fueled by a rational commitment to justice, but the irony is that, on the deepest level, it's playing out the same ugliness that's behind so many leftists' withholding of sorrow for Charlie Kirk.

Let me be clear: Nothing I said above should suggest excusing or justifying murder--at the end of the day, the murderer chose these actions, and no amount of adverse circumstances, developmental or otherwise, can absolve the moral responsibility that follows from performing volitional acts.

But, difficult through it may be (and I might be about to really stretch your tolerance), it is possible to hold two truths in your mind and heart simultaneously: (1) The murderer is a basically good person who, through a series of mistakes and _culpably_ bad choices, went down a path culminating in doing a horrifically, catastrophically bad thing; and (2) the murderer must be held accountable--and frankly, for an individual who is clearly so unhinged, permanent isolation from the rest of society (ie, prison) is probably the only practical solution, but a solution that we can, through great effort perhaps, implement with love and compassion in our hearts.

Oh, and I hasten to add that, while I've made all these points about compassion for the murderer in the broader context of articulating a general approach that counsels empathy and understanding and eschews the "shame talk" label of "evil" as applied to people, I do so more in the spirit of intellectual completeness and thoroughly exploring this issue. It would be _wildly_ inappropriate to elevate this issue to the status of being mentioned in even a 10-paragraph post on Facebook, commenting on this whole affair. For such posts, if the goal is to condemn a murder and call out its tragedy, including, perhaps, commenting on cultural dynamics and likely effects, it would detract from the sorrow expressed for Charlie Kirk in a terribly disrespectful way to mention, alongside that, how badly we might feel for the murderer, too. That would just be tone-deaf--even true ideas need to be expressed in contextually appropriate ways, and I hope that through the foregoing, I'm setting up that appropriate context.

## The Left Just Conceded That Charlie Kirk Was Right
or: here are the concrete ways in which murder is _wrong_ in this specific context

what it does to the strength of the ideas when they are shot down

## Conservative Hypocrisy
conservatives cheering for leftists getting what they deserve

curtailing free speech in response

## Charlie Kirk Out of Context
And what the hell difference does it make?

perversion of "empathy"

tradeoffs versus solutions (analogy to car wrecks)

holding Charlie Kirk accountable for his viewpoints

## Conclusion

So what did I mean by the title, "Charlie Kirk and the Erosion of Compassion"?
