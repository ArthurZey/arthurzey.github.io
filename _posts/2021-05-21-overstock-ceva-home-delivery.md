* Tuesday initial window. Got call, but nobody on the other line. I called back. Automated system told me I had to reschedule. While waiting for customer service rep, I rescheduled online for Wednesday. Agent assured me that I would for sure get it, after I asked why I should have any confidence that this time, they would make the delivery.
* Wednesday's window came and passed. No call. No show. I called back 3 times, and was on hold 3 times for 20 minutes each waiting for an agent. Meanwhile, their system told me about my upcoming appointment...in the past. Call sounded like it connected, but no agent on the other line. Got dumped into the satisfaction survey. Called Overstock. They issued a credit and opened an inquiry. Called Ceva again, and finally got through. They rescheduled to Friday. The item wasn't even in the city until that morning, so they couldn't get it to me.
* Friday, they confirmed by email that they would deliver to my apartment door, after the order said "to the door" and I gave them instructions. They were supposed to call me 30 minutes in advance and then when they arrived. They only called when they arrived. I noted that the boxes seemed quite small. They would only get the boxes to the elevator. I noticed that the boxes were for an office desk, not the daybed. I ran out after them. They mixed up the orders. Luckily, they had my order, with my name on a label, in the truck, and they swapped it out.

On 2021-05-09, I purchased an outdoor daybed on Overstock.com. The projected delivery was 2021-05-18. Perfect. Just in time for a gathering I was hosting on 2021-05-22. On 2021-05-12, I got a call from Ceva Logistics to schedule the home delivery, since it's an oversized item. I scheduled it for the first available window, 09:00 to 13:00 on 2021-05-18. So far, so good.

But then during the delivery window, I got a call from Ceva Logistics. I picked up, but there was nobody on the other line. I called back. The automated system told me that there was a problem with my delivery, and that I would have to reschedule. I waited on hold for about 20 minutes, and I was getting nervous. Before getting connected with a customer service agent, I went online and rescheduled for the next day, same time: 2021-05-19 09:00 to 13:00. When I was finally connected with the agent, she assured me that, despite the hiccup at the local facility today, they would be able to deliver the package tomorrow. I specifically asked how I could be certain that _this_ time, it would be delivered. She just assured me again. Okay, fine. Her visibility into the system is probably limited. But that raises serious questions about whether she should have projected so much confidence. Oh well.
