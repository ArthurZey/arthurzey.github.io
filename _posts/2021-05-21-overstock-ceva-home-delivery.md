* Tuesday initial window. Got call, but nobody on the other line. I called back. Automated system told me I had to reschedule. While waiting for customer service rep, I rescheduled online for Wednesday. Agent assured me that I would for sure get it, after I asked why I should have any confidence that this time, they would make the delivery.
* Wednesday's window came and passed. No call. No show. I called back 3 times, and was on hold 3 times for 20 minutes each waiting for an agent. Meanwhile, their system told me about my upcoming appointment...in the past. Call sounded like it connected, but no agent on the other line. Got dumped into the satisfaction survey. Called Overstock. They issued a credit and opened an inquiry. Called Ceva again, and finally got through. They rescheduled to Friday. The item wasn't even in the city until that morning, so they couldn't get it to me.
* Friday, they confirmed by email that they would deliver to my apartment door, after the order said "to the door" and I gave them instructions. They were supposed to call me 30 minutes in advance and then when they arrived. They only called when they arrived. I noted that the boxes seemed quite small. They would only get the boxes to the elevator. I noticed that the boxes were for an office desk, not the daybed. I ran out after them. They mixed up the orders. Luckily, they had my order, with my name on a label, in the truck, and they swapped it out.
