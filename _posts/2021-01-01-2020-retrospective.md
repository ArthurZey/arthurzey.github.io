Despite (most?) humans having a natural negativity bias as a sort of survival mechanism, I've long been what many people have described as an eternal optimist. Despite lots of awful stuff going on in the world, I tend to believe that things will work out, and increasingly, I've been able to just find joy in the present moment, without even worrying so much about the future.

The last few years had been pretty difficult. But 2020 has been a different beast altogether. I wish I could say that I had the internal strength to be resilient to the challenges thrown at me, but I've been severely dysregulated by a confluence of...I don't even know what to call them...together, they're a shitstorm of hellfuckery. Sure, I had my part to play in these situations; undoubtedly, there were things I could have done better, which is much easier to see in hindsight. But I was doing my fucking best. And when that _best_ ends up corresponding to being so severely beaten down, it's hard to not believe in a malevolent universe premise.

As I'm writing this in the beginning of January 2021, I'm in a really bad and dark place. I'm doing all the allegedly right things that my therapist and all the books recommend: I'm eating well, I'm exercising, I'm sleeping, I'm spending time with friends, I'm pursuing my interests (snowboarding, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/112945867-arthur-zey?shelf=read&sort=date_read&order=d), book clubs / study groups), I'm taking time to grieve, I'm participating in support groups. (Thank goodness for my [rules](/rules/) / [OCO](/obsessive-compulsive-order/) / [discipline](/discipline/), I suppose.) None of that shit is helping, and I'm sick to death of all the advice about self-love and self-compassion and believing that I'm fundamentally "enough" and "worthy of love and belonging". None of that has ever been the problem. My experience of all this turmoil is not that there's something wrong with _me_ (whatever [growth](/growth/) I'm still pursuing), but that the universe is just a fundamentally fucked up place and the people who inhabit it are not to be trusted. However much I might intellectually believe that this is temporary, emotionally, I can't connect with the belief that I can experience happiness and joy again. And I'm struggling to connect with other people, too, especially in a romaintic-sexual context, as I'm trying to [move on](#end-of-relationship-with-adam). Yeah, sure, I can take joy in the little things, day to day, but by and large, everything feels like it's in grayscale, like a living death...living, but not really _alive_. So my dominant experience of existence is cycling through feeling numb and incapacitated and overwhelmed, feeling anxious and frantic and panicked, crying uncontrollably, and being angry and hateful. At least I can take pride in never having taken out my frustration on anybody else.

To put your mind at ease, I'll say unequivocally that I'm not suicidal. I'm too averse to one-way doors to even do myself intentional temporary harm.

It's almost funny that with everything I endured in 2020, almost none of it had anything to do with COVID-19. I'm sure the pandemic had a magnifying effect on some of the things I went through, but for the most part, it's barely been a blip on my emotional radar. If anything, it's given me the excuse I wanted to just stay at home, isolated from everybody else anyway.

For all my enlightenment and meditation, blah, blah, blah, I find that accepting and living with _what is_ has started to feel unbearable. Either all that work is doing nothing, or I might have been in an even worse place, unimaginable though that might be. The idea of moving forward with how things have turned out makes me sick to my stomach and makes my heart race. I've never so desperately wanted to be able to [go back in time and redo everything](/superpowers/). I feel like I've wasted my life, and I feel powerless to achieve the things I have come to hold dear.

And here, I've just [started on a new team at Amazon](#changing-teams-at-amazon), and I'm trying to get excited about that and at least be effective in my job. I'm trying so hard to just put one foot in front of the other, and that's so hard when I can barely get out of bed in the morning.

# Burglary of Storage Unit

When I updated one of my dating profiles and answered the prompt "Six things I could never do without", I wrote "the physical and digital things/memorabilia that serve as anchors for my memory and nostalgia".

On December 29, I stopped by my storage unit in Arvada, where I had deposited 59 27-gallon bins on October 14 as part of [moving to Denver](/2020-10-14/move-to-denver/). I was there with my friend Christopher to retrieve a spare ski jacket for him, since we had plans to go to Steamboat Springs.

When I opened my unit, I found that it had been burglarized. As of January 4, I still haven't taken a full inventory of what was stolen, but I counted 26 missing bins. Every bin marked "Memorabilia" was gone. That's everything from my entire life, going back to childhood. Every photo. Every trinket from my desks through the years. Every concert program that I saved. The flower I gave Adam on our anniversary. The map of the Denver Botanical Gardens from my trip with Adam. All my _Star Trek_ collectables. All my DVDs and VHS tapes and CDs. My Sega Genesis and _Sonic: The Hedgehog_ stuff. My pony tails. My coin collection. Jewelry. All my Boy Scouts stuff and accomplishments, including my uniform and merit badge sash. My report cards and yearbooks from school. My Hogwarts robes. A snowboard, even. And so much more.

I summoned the police, and they took fingerprints. I at least had the presence of mind to fall back on what I'd learned from all those crime procedurals that I watched and not touch anything before they arrived and collected as much forensic evidence as possible. Yes, there are some leads that we're pursuing, but the facility has no cameras near my unit, and the available data is sparse, particularly because we don't know for sure when between October 14 and December 29 this happened. Frankly, I have no expectation that I will ever get my things back. I have reason to believe that this happened closer to October, and if that's true, then all the valuable things will long have been sold and the rest dumped.

This has been horrifically devastating for me, and not even so much because of the violation, but the sheer loss of all those things that were meant to be a "backup" for what I know is a fragile and delicate and unreliable thing: human memory. These are things that I had hoped to share with my children one day, looking through them and telling them about my life. Now all that is gone. Just. Fucking. Gone.

Yes, other people suffer similar loses, and they go on with their lives. Numerous people, in the spirit of trying to be helpful, have tried to remind me of this fact, but if we're going to be doing comparisons to other people, then perhaps consider how much I in particular am attached to physical things. I even made it [a bullet in my "about me"](/about/#random-tidbits:~:text=I'm%20extremely%20materialistic%20in%20that%20I,most%20people%20would%20regard%20as%20unimportant). During all the effort I expended in October carefully organizing and packing up my disaster zone of a storage unit in Sunnyvale, I came across so many thing that brought a big grin to my face (and even tears of joy), despite its being such a stressful time for me. I can't even begin to explain how much of a loss this is for me. As the capstone to 2020, going on just feels unbearable and all the more unreal. This isn't a "fresh start". This isn't "liberation". This is just horseshit.
