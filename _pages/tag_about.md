Something, something, perfect enemy of the good.

I'm Arthur. This is my website. I threw together a basic structure using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com){:target="&lowbar;blank"} (because tech geek) to get something off the ground quickly.

I have about a million and one things I'm passionate about that I want to get out of my brain and onto proverbial paper.

Some of it is about me personally and my own history, experiences, and growth. Some of it is observations about the world, social and interpersonal dynamics, philosophy, psychology, and other not-about-me-directly things like TV, product design, and project management. Some content is in style of date-specific [blog posts](/blog/), and some content is captured in "timeless", "living" posts...I haven't written any of the latter yet, but I have created a ton of [stubs](/stubs/) to give an indication of what I want to write about (and there are a [ton more I haven't created stubs for yet](https://github.com/ArthurZey/arthurzey.github.io/issues/4){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, too).

Frankly, a huge motive for me here is to create what amounts to an "Arthur wiki" or "Arthur user's guide". Whether you want to get to know me or you're just interested in my thoughts... Buckle up.

Elevator pitch about me:

I'm a logic-emotions monist, open (almost to a fault), wholehearted, wild, untamed, _and_ disciplined in mind and action. (I wrote a decent stub on [Family Arguing](/family-arguing/) that proposes a causality for how I came to be this way.)

I tend to be a generalist and selective specialist, but a huge nerd through and through. I'm a die-hard advocate of induction as the primary mode of human cognition. My superpowers include seeing patterns and untangling nuanced differences. I'm especially good at seeing underlying principles, whether in human behavior or API design, as well as finding general, future-proof solutions to seemingly disparate problems. Check out my [Personality and Behavioral Profiles](#personality-and-behavioral-profiles) below.

To me, integrity means _integrating_ mind, body, and spirit. It means continuously learning rational (ie, practical) principles, and walking the walk and talking the talk. I embrace consistency and reject compartmentalization. I'm a geek about intellectual pursuits, I'm maniacal about physical fitness (in health, bodybuilding, and diet), and I'm always learning and growing in the areas of mindfulness and empathy (thank you, meditation).

Also, I love [logging things](#footer) in the spirit of [Quantified Self](https://quantifiedself.com/about/what-is-quantified-self/){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, though it's not an especially social phenomenon for me. Part of my love of it is in bringing order to the chaos of life through data normalization.

What is "The Truth about the Dishwasher"? You'll have to wait until I write about it...

While I buck a lot of social conventions and many of the superficial manifestations of my traits are baffling to a lot of people (believe me, I will write plenty on this), if you really get me, if you _really see and understand the core of my being_, I am super predictable.

I love children, and I can't wait to be a dad.

I'm the product manager for [Alexa Tech Docs](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa){:target="&lowbar;blank"} for Amazon.

I grew up in Los Angeles, and I live in San Francisco (but maybe not for long).

Random tidbits:
* I'm a homebody. The chances of my initiating going out to eat, to a bar, or to a club are extremely slim. Dark, loud, and/or crowded? No, thanks. My perfect Friday or Saturday night involves going to bed early.
* I'm a creature of habit; I love my routines and comforts.
* I hate wearing clothes. Specifically, I love being shirtless. It's a manifestation of my extreme vanity. (More on _that_ controversial and triggering topic later!)
* I've been eating strict [Paleo](/paleo/) (with various modifications and refinements) since 2009. No cheating.
* I'm a compulsive nail-biter and "investigator" of my dermatological phenomena. (These are things I struggle with _a lot_.)
* I'm extremely risk-averse, definitely to a fault and in a very anxiety-provoking way. This is a disposition I really need to keep in check.
* I'm extremely materialistic in that I attach high sentimental value to things most people would regard as unimportant--so I can't throw anything away. But with the exception of groceries and occasional tech splurges, I'm pretty darned frugal by nature.
* Listening to music is a very active process for me (meaning humming or singing along), so it's really hard for me to ever have it on in the background. It also means I don't much care for intentional music discovery (like Pandora). Invite me to the symphony, opera, or ballet if you're prepared to be hitting me every 5 seconds to stop me from signing along.
* I've never been to a music performance that didn't involve sitting in seats, but [I do like quite a bit of contemporary music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0mTrpgBmH0j2r8fDyn4xV5){:target="&lowbar;blank"}.
* I don't dance. Well, that's not true: I'm very comfortable learning dancing styles that have predefined moves that I might recombine on the fly to music (eg, swing, salsa, tango), and I've taken a few classes here and there. I tend to pick that up pretty well, but I'm not especially skilled. What I _don't_ do is the random move-your-body-to-the-beat kind of dancing that's typical at clubs, weddings, etc. It's not that I'm inhibited in that regard; it's _just not me_. I _feel_ stupid doing it, even though I don't think anybody else looks stupid doing it, and I _know_ I don't look stupid to anybody else. I wouldn't do it in private, either...that also feels really uncomfortable. I used to be embarrassed about that and wished I could fit in, but nowadays, I'm way more comfortable just not participating, despite everybody else's attempts to talk me into dancing (which I think amounts to an unintentional attempt to shame me into it). Nope. Not me. Thanks!
* I scrupulously avoid reading any news except tech news. I'm blissfully and self-righteously ignorant of current events. I find that most news disproportionately reports on the sensationalistic negative stuff going on around the world, perhaps catering to a sort of schadenfreude. Aside from finding that distasteful on philosophical grounds, I think it misrepresents the proportion of bad and good in the world and skews our perception of how good life is. There is so much good and wonderfulness in the world; I'd rather focus on that. And I'd much rather risk having a disproportionately positive view of the world than negative. Moreover, I have close to 0% control over nearly 100% of the negative stuff reported in "the news", and there's very little I can do differently on the basis of "being informed"; so what's the point? Yes, sure, I can fight for cultural change in the long term, but being informed of broad trends and certain major current events is inescapable, no matter how well I avoid explicitly pursuing "the news"; I don't need to be inundated with negativity to have a motive to live a good life and work to improve the world (if anything, that negativity would sap my energy to do so).
* I'm also fairly ignorant of history (which is actually a shame). If anything, I tend to know more about historical trends and periods than the "who's who" of history.
* I know very little about pop culture or spectator sports, neither of which I have much patience for. The most I might know is a little about actors in my favorite shows/movies and sports I've actually played.
* My favorite movie is [_The Time Traveler's Wife_](https://trakt.tv/movies/the-time-traveler-s-wife-2009){:target="&lowbar;blank"}.
* 1 out of 10 [_Star Trek: The Next Generation_](https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek-the-next-generation){:target="&lowbar;blank"} episodes makes me cry. My favorites are [_Who Watches the Watchers_](https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek-the-next-generation/seasons/3/episodes/4){:target="&lowbar;blank"} and [_The Offspring_](https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek-the-next-generation/seasons/3/episodes/16){:target="&lowbar;blank"}. I'll let you make your own inferences about how much I cry during other TV shows and movies.
* My favorite fiction book is [_Atlas Shrugged_](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B003V8B5XO){:target="&lowbar;blank"}. The [_His Dark Materials_](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B005WBBYXO){:target="&lowbar;blank"} trilogy is a close second because _fuck authority_.
* I ran a philosophy club at UCLA called LOGIC for about 7 years between 2004 and 2011. I took it extremely seriously and organized it as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. We put on some very high-profile and well-attended events.
* Some of my closest friends are from [middle school](http://reedms.com/pleslc-information/ihp-information/){:target="&lowbar;blank"}.
* The most consistent and frequent trigger of my anger is bad UX on mobile apps and websites.
* I dropped out of high school. (Okay...I say that for dramatic effect. I [tested out](https://www.chspe.net/){:target="&lowbar;blank"} after 10th grade because I ran out of AP math and science classes...kind of.)
* Technically, Russian is my first language, and my parents forced me to go to Russian School on Saturdays for 11 years (maybe [here](https://hvmla.org/our-community/children/){:target="&lowbar;blank"}?)...unsurprisingly, with my willful personality, I didn't get much out of it. I took French in high school and college. I took one quarter of Italian at UCLA.
* I studied piano pretty seriously between the ages of 7 and 18  (now I just dabble), I played flute in grades 6 and 7, and I was in choir in grades 7 through 10.
* I'm an Eagle Scout.
* I graduated from [law school](/law-school/) and even passed the CA Bar Exam.
* Bren√© Brown "speed round" / "rapid fire" from [Unlocking Us](https://brenebrown.com/unlockingus/){:target="&lowbar;blank"}:
  * _Vulnerability is_\\
    honesty to yourself.
  * _You're called to do something brave, but your fear is real. What's the very first thing you do?_\\
    breathe
  * _Something that people often get wrong about you is_\\
    that I like arguing, just because I'm willing to defend my beliefs.
  * _Last show that you watched, binged, and loved:_\\
    [as of April 2020, _The Magicians_](https://trakt.tv/users/arthurzey/history?show=100940){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
  * _Favorite movie:_\\
    [_The Time Traveler's Wife_](https://trakt.tv/movies/the-time-traveler-s-wife-2009){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
  * _A concert that you'll never forget:_\\
    While at university, I got access to discounted student tickets to the LA Opera to see Mozart's _The Magic Flute_. We got seats 4 rows from the stage, and my friends had to keep hitting me to stop singing along, since I had been listening to all the songs on repeat for a week leading up to it.
  * _Favorite meal:_\\
    ribeye steak, with a side of french fries cooked in beef tallow, a gigantic salad, and a glass of Malbec
  * _What's on your nightstand right now?_\\
    on 2020-04-26: Phillip Pullman's [_Once Upon a Time in the North_](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0399555447){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, my mala beads, my (non-military) dogtags, a few Pixel phones, an empty glass (for water), and a some folded clothes
  * _A snapshot of an ordinary moment in your life that brings you joy:_\\
    snuggling with [Billy](https://photos.app.goo.gl/4RW6d5j2af9aq4pbA){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
  * _What are you deeply grateful for right now?_\\
    my friends who truly see and understand me

### Parenting and Education
_A parent's job is to be a guide in a child's development into an adult. A parent is a model, not an authority figure. A child must learn, not obey. A parent should not try to tame their child or desire obedience, but to help the child cultivate the skills of agency, self-determination, self-regulation, independent judgment, internal motivation, and efficacy. "Punishment", ranging from grounding to stonewalling to physical striking are not effective tools; they teach a child that these are normal modes of interaction between human beings and handicap their future adult relationships. Punishment and "consequences" create power struggles and undermine the possibility of finding win-win solutions. While I wouldn't say it's always wrong to characterize a child as "misbehaving", the more useful framing is to understand that the child is attempting to achieve a value, perhaps ineffectively, and that it's the parent's job to help the child learn more effective ways of achieving values. Regardless, approaching a child with anger or phrases such as "You're bad." and "You're being bad." (which a child is likely to internalize as a matter of basic identity) are disastrous._

  This is, hands-down, the most important innovation in math education in history, and I don't say that lightly. Grant Sanderson's approach to grounding math in graphical intuition and connecting it to reality has the ability to inspire curiosity and passion and prevent kids from checking out of math because of how it's so often taught as merely abstract symbol manipulation.

[_Philosophy: Who Needs It_](https://courses.aynrand.org/works/philosophy-who-needs-it/){:target="&lowbar;blank"}

> Your subconscious is like a computer--more complex a computer than men can build--and its main function is the integration of your ideas. Who programs it? Your conscious mind. If you default, **if you don't reach any firm convictions, your subconscious is programmed by chance--and you deliver yourself into the power of ideas you do not know you have accepted**. But one way or the other, your computer gives you print-outs, daily and hourly, in the form of _emotions_--which are lightning-like estimates of the things around you, calculated according to your values. If you programmed your computer by conscious thinking, you know the nature of your values and emotions. If you didn't, you don't.

_Okay, so I feel like I need to offer a fair bit of clarification on this, since I think terms like "selfishness" and "capitalism" can be readily polarizing and misunderstood, given widespread (mis)use in our culture. I'll do more of that clarification in a post at some point. For now, here's a summary of my viewpoints, which I credit to Objectivism and Ayn Rand._
* metaphysics: absolute reality\\
_Facts are what they are. Our mere fact of believing or wishing does not change them._
* epistemology: knowledge through induction\\
_Concepts are inductive generalizations of observations of concrete entities given in perception, as well as of other concepts. Bona fide knowledge and certainty is always contextual; new discoveries and understanding does not inherently overturn previous knowledge, but in a proper progression, builds on and expands it._
* ethics: egoism\\
_The moral purpose of my life is my own happiness, prosperity, and joy, not the mere satisfaction of momentary hedonistic whims or pleasures. Sterilely, the purpose of my relationships with other people is to serve my own well-being, but I experience others as a tremendous potential or actual value to my life, and therefore, emotionally, as ends in themselves. I seek out win-win relationships. I believe people's true interests are harmonious, so there are no win-lose relationships; anything purported to be a win-lose relationship is really a lose-lose relationship. I reject the glorification of sacrifice and suffering. More concretely, the egoistic [virtues](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/virtue.html){:target="&lowbar;blank"} I embrace are [rationality](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/rationality.html){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, [independence](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/independence.html){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, [integrity](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/integrity.html){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, [honesty](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/honesty.html){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, [justice](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/justice.html){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, [productiveness](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/productiveness.html){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, and [pride](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/pride.html){:target="&lowbar;blank"}._
  * Tara Smith: _Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist_: [Kindle](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00INYGFWM/){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
* politics: (laissez-faire) capitalism\\
_The concept of "individual rights" identifies the factual requirements of human flourishing in a social context; the concept identifies the actions that are permissible and prohibited in a society if we want to create the conditions that **enable** prosperity. Negatively put, the initiation of physical force (including fraud) and its threat are prohibited. Positively put, people may act on their own independent judgment with respect to their own person and property, provided they do not interfere with others' ability to do the same. This amounts to **freedom** and what it means to live in a free society (we are not very close to that at present)._
* aesthetics: romantic realism\\
_The purpose of art is to provide spiritual fuel and to directly evoke emotions in a way that may bypass explicit conceptual awareness._
