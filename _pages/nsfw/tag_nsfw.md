I hope you didn't land on this page expecting anything pornographic.

The reason that I characterized this section as "not safe for work" has more to do with the fact that I discuss explicit sexual content, usually about me specifically, and that's the sort of stuff you don't talk about with your coworkers, since in our society, it risks some unpleasant or uncomfortable interactions or dynamics.

Nothing here is "private" in the sense that it's anything that I'm secretive about, but given our culture's somewhat schizophrenic and unhealthy relationship with sex, I'm treading carefully in terms of what content I'm making especially easily discoverable. Anybody who's motivated can find any of this, not the least of which because it's all committed to my public GitHub repository for this site.

So if you're looking for nude pictures of me, I'm sad to say that you'll be disappointed. But if you're interested in learning more about my views and attitudes about various aspects of my own sexuality, read on.
