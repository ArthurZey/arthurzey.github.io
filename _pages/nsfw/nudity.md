Odds are that I referred you to this page because I told you that I don't send nude pics (and I don't even snap them), and you were all like "Why?". Well, here we go.

In 2002, when I started being pretty open about my sexuality and dating and hooking up with guys (I suppose you can say that's when I pretty fully "came out"), our culture was one where I saw people misusing dick pics and the like for blackmail and attempted shaming.

At that time, I was already a huge computer nerd, and I knew quite well that "the internet is forever" and that if you take a photo, you can expect that it will _never_ disappear.

Also at that time, I had this idea in my mind that I might one day have a career that would put me in the public spotlight. I wasn't sure yet exactly what form that would take, but I was developing what turned into a serious activist streak that lasted through 2010, and I went to law school 2005-2009 as a manifestation of that passion. Maybe I would ultimately be in business or head an activist organization or be a judge. I didn't know yet, but I didn't want nude pics coming back to bite me in the ass. I wanted to keep my options open.

It's not that I personally had any shame about nude pics. I wasn't worried about ridicule or anything. And I don't have any problem with people who do snap and send nude pics--hey, more power to ya!

But given where our culture was and my concern about how it could affect me reputationally (even though I disagreed with the premise underlying the idea that my reputation should be damaged at all), I decided it would be best to err on the side of caution. Like it or not, I had to navigate a world that was simultaneously very skanky and very Victorian, and I was doing my best.

I did try nude video chats a few times (I think around 2005), but I quickly realized the risk in that, too, given that people could take screenshots.

So I ended up with this policy of never even snapping nude pics, and despite some ways in which our culture has changed for the better (despite how schizophrenic it remains about nudity, sex, and sexuality in many ways), and despite the fact that I have exactly zero interest today in any life in the public eye, I guess through inertia, it's just solidified into a sort of boundary for me.

The short of it is that I remain uncomfortable with the prospect of sending nude pics, but I'm not shy at all about being nude in person. It's not a matter of having any kind of hangups about sex; there are no shame issues here; there's no internalized homophobia or any other such self-esteem issue at play.

That's not to say that I won't ever change my position on this matter; it's not like I view this as a moral issue. Part of me wants to, but given how longstanding a policy this has been for me, I'd need to make a decision to change it very thoughtfully, deliberately, and soberly (and not because I happen to be horny one day!). Perhaps one day, I will decide to snap some nude photos. And then maybe I'll even share some. But today is not that day. And if you're hoping, I'd encourage you to not hold your breath.

## Some Background Context

While I was a "late bloomer" in some respects (onset of puberty, when I started dating and being sexually active with other people), I became aware of myself as a sexual being quite early, no later than 7 years old (which is the oldest I remember starting to jack off--it could have been younger).

I even remember this one scene from my early childhood--I might have been 4, maybe 5, years old, and I was alone in my bedroom, climbing around in the closet (no metaphor intended!) like a monkey in some tighty whities and suspenders. There was something about the addition of the suspenders that made the whole thing sexual for me (though I have no such fetish today). Of course, I had no explicit concept or understanding of it, but when my nanny walked in on me, I was super embarrassed and scampered away to cover myself. Clearly, some messages from our culture about nudity and sex and "privacy" had gotten through to me on a subconscious level.

Anecdotes like that, in combination with things like never having any experience with or exposure to non-sexual nudity, led to my _really_ sexualizing (fetishizing?) nudity. And so nudity was never a "no big deal" kind of thing for me. All the other messages I passively absorbed through the culture were that nudity and sex are integral to one another. (For the record, I never directly experienced or was "exposed to" sexual nudity as a child, either, but one makes subconscious integrations based on things on TV, in the movies, etc. What's odd is that my parents never made a big deal of nudity in the way that a lot of parents in our culture do, and I occasionally saw them naked, so I really don't know what to make of that.)

So growing up, there was a bit of a vicious cycle around being naked: I was never around naked peers in non-sexual contexts (eg, in a lockerroom), so I didn't have any experiences to challenge the "nudity is sexual" idea, so I was especially shy about being naked, so I avoided situations where I might be naked around others. (Surprise, surprise, then, that as my sexual development continued, lockerrooms, bathhouses, nude beaches, and clothing-optional hotsprings and resorts all turned into major fetishes for me.)

As I got older and was actually ready to start engaging in sexual activity with other people (there was a lot of rationalism around that and why it happened so late, but that's another story altogether), I also started wanting to get over my shyness about being naked.

So it took a lot of effort and a lot of courage to force myself to be naked in front of other people when it shouldn't matter. It's difficult to disentangle what has become a deeply engrained sexualized element to it, but intellectually, I do believe that nudity should be no big deal and that it isn't inherently sexual. Sex should also be no big deal, which is not to say that it should be treated casually or disrespectfully, but rather that it shouldn't be treated as shameful, sinful, furtive, or clandestine. So I forced myself to be get naked in lockerrooms and the like, and I eventually managed to desensitize myself to the discomfort of being naked around others.

And here's another random tidbit: I don't recall having a lot of "naked" dreams as a kid, but at least as an adult (I guess correlating with my having gotten over my shyness), I frequently have dreams in which I'm naked in circumstances that are not socially appropriate in real life (school, restaurants, walking along the sidewalk, you name it). But what's interesting about these dreams is my emotional state: I'm not embarrassed or ashamed of my nakedness, but I _am_ acutely aware of the social impropriety, and to the extent that I make any effort to avoid being seen naked or to cover myself up, it's more about wanting to conform to cultural norms and not make _others_ uncomfortable. In these dreams, though, the nakedness is rarely, if ever, sexual. (I do occasionally have sex dreams, but those are usually set in "socially appropriate" places, like bedrooms, sex clubs, or lockerroom showers.)

I'm guessing a bit at the psychological causality here, but the way I would summarize it is as follows: Growing up, nudity was sexual for me. Correlatively, since I wasn't ready to have sex with other people yet, I wasn't comfortable being naked in front of them, either. This more deeply engrained in my subconscious the idea that nudity was _very_ private, even more so than is maybe the default in our culture (which is way too much already, in my view). When I did start to engage in sexual activity with other people, I had no problem being naked with them, but I realized that I had to at least partially undo the "nudity is sexual" connection, because I found it absurd that I felt so uncomfortable being naked in front of others in non-sexual contexts. So, while nudity remains subconsciously linked to sexuality for me, I have managed to carve out some dimension of nudity where I can be comfortable being naked around others in a non-sexual way, too. It took some doin', but I think my feelings and comfort around nudity largely match my conscious convictions now.
