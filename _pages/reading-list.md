Let's just say that I use the word "read" loosely: I include here audiobooks that I've listened to, but I'm not including podcasts or one-off audio productions (such as recorded lectures).

Not up to date (yet?), but see also [my Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/arthurzey){:target="&lowbar;blank"} and my [my Audible Listener Page](https://www.audible.com/listener/A21N9AKRB4509R){:target="&lowbar;blank"}.

## Susan Campbell: _From Triggered to Tranquil_

{% comment %}
* How do I tell whether something is a trigger or just something I find intolerable?
* For instance, lying, hypocrisy, or injustice--perhaps my heightened sensitivity to these is a result of some childhood experiences (in which case, is there a "core wound" involved?), but these are also things that we just rightly need to hold others accountable for and deal with in an effective manner. When is "trigger work" appropriate, and when is something else appropriate? When I'm thrown into dysregulation by having my time wasted by or dealing with incompetent customer "service", is that kind of trigger a result of a core wound (and if so, how can I figure out what that is?), or is it something else?
* What is the connection to Attachment Theory? Is there more to say about this topic in light of different attachment styles, or is it just a matter of different attachment styles tending toward different triggers (because of the different correlative core wounds)?

* Acceptance: of what is versus what ought to be?
* Is my apparent introversion actually a manifestation of avoiding people because of my people pleasing tendencies?
* Chapter 3 (Project 2): Even though not clear about the definition, makes good points about "forgiveness" and what it does _not_ demand.

## Robert Sapolsky: _Behave_
[Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B06XW3MVNF){:target="&lowbar;blank"} | [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IAUGC5S/)
{% comment %}
* Chapters 13 and 14: virtue ethics, muddling use of "selfish", especially with empathy
* Sometimes empathy itself lessens others' pain and provides comfort
* Very end of chapter 14: false dichotomies about exploiting versus being exploited
* Behave 16: straw man of "complete free will"; more to the point, doesn't seem to address what the phenomenon we all experience actually is
* Tries to use the analogy that because we got rid of punishment of epilepsy as reflecting some kind of satanic possession, we could do that with all forms of punishment for all behaviors, which is exactly what erases the distinction between a volitional and non-volitional act. He thinks that the relevant thing around punishment is whether it's caused. And even if I believe that punishment is a bad idea in all or most cases, it's not because all actions are caused. It's because I don't think it's the most effective way to deal with volitional acts.
* It seems one of his conclusions is that punishment can't be deserved, but that's because he's defined desert out of existence. Again, I might not believe that punishment is a good idea for various reasons, but it has nothing to do with whether someone's behavior was determined (inside or outside the person's control). He's also equating punishment/desert with a sort of mystical retributivism.
* But still, he touches an important point about how we go about moralizing and dealing with issues of good versus evil. The analogy to the broken car that's evil is a little absurd, since it has no processes that could be characterized as being volitional, whatever that even is "under the hood".
* Chapter 17: claims that it is not inevitable that humans will behave any particular way, contradicting his determinism view in the previous chapter. He thinks individuals can "make a difference".

{% comment %}
* Chapter 1: the bias of thinking one is unbiased: denial is the proof you have a problem
* Chapter 2: muddled use of "humility" and "arrogance"
* Chapter 3: infinite regress / self-refuting position around identification with ideas; false dichotomy in terms of opinions versus values; it's actually okay to look for what's potentially wrong about something that contradicts your beliefs, if you know you've been careful about reaching your beliefs
* Chapter 4: lots of good distinctions between different types of disagreement/arguing/debating, being agreeable/disagreeable, willingness to defend views versus attacking people, etc
* Chapter 5: "willingness to change mind means open to learning"; depends on the issue and how you made up your mind in the first place
* Chapter 6: after space travel, less concern with individual achievement and more concern with collective good
  * Also, changing someone's mind needs to depend on something actually being true. Convincing someone of a falsehood is just manipulation.
  * The whole tenor of the book so far is that the viewpoints and opinions are ultimately arbitrary, even if they vary in how much they can be supported by various facts.
  * Not all stereotypes are the same. Isn't that ironic? Some stereotypes are actually based on an inductive process, whereas others are just prejudice.
  * "we might question our belief that it makes sense to hold opinions about groups at all": depends on what kind of groups and whether the opinion is about a characteristic essential to the group
* Chapter 7: good analysis about listening and understanding, instead of convincing
* Chapter 8: "climate change" is, ironically, not a monolithic idea
* "If you find yourself saying that anything is always good, then you might be a member of an idea cult."
* "No behavior is always effective "
* Chapter 9: "Pluto is not a planet, no longer true; Columbus discovered America, never true."
* Chapter 10: process accountability instead of result accountability; Amazon PR-FAQ; gets "disagree and commit" wrong
* conclusion: Pursuit of happiness and individualistic versus collectivistic societies; direct pursuit versus process orientation

## Benjamin Hardy: _The Gap and the Gain_
[Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B09HN7K7W8){:target="&lowbar;blank"} | [Kindle](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B08TGTK2L2){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
{% comment %}
* Jefferson pursuit of happiness
* Can't be in gap and gain at the same time: but what about my fitness
* Personal ideals are equated with interpersonal comparisons because "external"
* Can't achieve an ideal; not what ideals are for
* Needs versus wants
* Want it because I want it; justifications are rationalizations and second-handed
* Watching TV is about others' worlds instead of own interests; ignores value of thinking about fiction
* Just reframing all unpleasant experiences as gains of one kind or another is an example of toxic positivity, and it undermines the emotional mechanisms of processing things and can breed resentment and later angry outbursts
* Using the word fairness to equivocate between Justice and equality, in describing how a concern with fairness is a sign of emotional immaturity and being in the gap
* Mental subtraction and "needing" things: if there's something that I would regret not having, then I "need it"
* Focusing on past mistakes, eg, government response to COVID, as being unhelpful. Instead of thinking about the future: sometimes, analyzing the past can be very helpful terms of extracting what best you can learn from it
* A problem with doing goal setting by primary reference only to prior accomplishments is that that might optimize for local Maxima, rather than global Maxima. Sometimes, we have pursued and achieved various accomplishments that are not connected to our actual goals or what would actually make us happy
* We make up interpretations of things that happen: subjectivism
* Trading is a zero-sum game

{% comment %}
* Chapter 4: parallel between desirable and undesirable confusion and good and bad stress
* Generating curiosity in education. Very connected to the approach I learned about from falling Apple institute with respect to astronomy
* Chapter 8: shame is self-focused, empathy is other focused. But perfectionism is other focused and self-improvement is self-focused. Miss use of the word selfish.
* Chapter 13: narcissism depends on a view of oneself as good detached from accomplishments, but that's also true of inherent worthiness

{% comment %}
* 14% in: So far, really resenting the condescending "This describes all gay men; if you don't feel this way, you're not introspecting hard enough and are repressing." message. I'll keep reading, in hopes that it will at least give me an insight into what may be the experience of many gay men.
* Really awful advice about distracting yourself when you're feeling depressed or some other unpleasant emotion because it wallowing allegedly makes you feel more of it. Basically, it's risking repression.
* Basically, this describes most people, using gays as a particular case study. Very little was specific to gays; I see the same patterns in people all around (especially men, but also women), and it may simply be especially magnified among gays for various reasons. But most of the advice was general and applicable to most people, gay or straight, male or female.

* poverty and wealth both ruin children
* Going to "best" school can be a disadvantage because getting mediocre in a competitive school can be demoralizing. Presupposes second-handedness.

* Five levels of attachment fanatical beliefs are problematic as such. Commitments to ideas of an ideal world require imposition of those views on others.

* Equivocation on taking things personally, since there are things that are personal, and that dilutes the understanding of this principle

* Equivocation on freedom

{% comment %}
HIGH-LEVEL NOTES
* Chapter 8 (Audible): diminishing returns of morality treats the phenomenon as substance-agnostic, and ignoring the whole purpose and need for morality in the first place. Morality, properly understood, is a set of principles to attain certain kinds of optimums, not out of context maximums. So there can't be such a thing as too much of an optimum.
* Chapter 9 (Audible): same approach to justice, and its being a categorical value, contrasting Smith and Rawls
* Chapter 16 (Audible): "social expediency in a long-term sense"
* Misuse of the word objective
* Chapter 10 (Book): knowledge costs around ad hoc decisions could mention conceptualization and automatization
* Chapter 22 (Audible): "ideology" immune from reality
* Chapter 23 (Audible): freedom equated with ability
* If all men were angels, no government would be necessary. Reflects attitude about objectivity and values

HIGH-LEVEL NOTES
* art being for enjoyment versus a practical purpose (isn't enjoyment a practical purpose?)
* definition of needs versus wants (needs are inborn; wants are acquired)
* we "should pursue happiness" (seems like a stolen concept, since happiness is what gives rise to "shoulds" in the first place)
* limitations on freedom (and what the concept is in general)
* concepts (eg, "dog") can't be wrong (but what about improperly formed concepts?)
* definition of knowledge versus opinions
* limited versus unlimited goods

HIGH-LEVEL NOTES
* Automatic processes, particularly the ones that make one susceptible to certain kinds of systemic biases or errors, are not rational or irrational, they are arational.
* Discussion about money-priming and selfishness presupposes a certain idea of what selfishness is (which is smuggling in various false premises).
* "Individualism is a reluctance to be involved with others"
* The Halo effect may not be as irrational as author implies. There's a reason that we think that certain things are causally linked.
* In the example of the legality of the arrest of a union employee who wants to talk to store's employees is only problematic and affected by different presentations of arguments if you don't have a principled viewpoint of the underlying facts in the first place.
* Talks about propensity to assess costs and benefits of particular political policies by whether you like them, which reverses cause and effect for people who think about it objectively. (affect heuristic)
* Argues that public policy should address fears because they are debilitating. How about calibrating fear or training resilience?
* Way too much commentary that undermines certainty, including suspicion of people who are certain.
* I'm optimistic, and perhaps have an optimistic bias, but I'm also subject to deep bouts of depression, and I'm risk averse. I wonder if there's actually a good causal explanation here.
* The better than average "fallacy" doesn't actually apply to individuals. Any given individual might have good reason to believe they are above average (and may well be), even if there's no way that 90% of people, who think they are better than average, are actually better than average. You can't use this alleged fallacy to invalidate any given assertion by any given individual.
* There's something in Prospect Theory, the endowment effect, risk-/loss-aversion, etc that's begging for more analysis:
  * the ideas as descriptive versus prescriptive
  * the meaning of "rationality" from which these observed phenomena depart
  * something that's missing about whether something like giving higher weight to pain of loss than pleasure of gain is
    * normatively good
    * itself a function of deeper (and perhaps prevalent) automatized values (versus an inherent psychological fact)
* Moral intuitions around the tax code for children of the rich versus poor is only problematic in terms of its being dominated by system one if your system one is badly trained.
* What an amazing confession about morality that he thinks it's not a function of system 2.
* Freedom to choose does not depend on the conventional rational agent model
* Total straw man of the Chicago School of economics in the end credits

HIGH-LEVEL NOTES
* result of affirmative action programs in law schools show little difference in outcomes after law school, which is not reconcileable with the psychological effects of being worse off than your peers
* Calls Mexican laborers in California feudal surfs
* Chapter 7: it slips in a jab about how the United States is individualistic and therefore doesn't provide its citizens with universal health care
* Chapter 9: why are we glorifying the comparison of children's progress against one another, rather than prioritizing things like play and fun?
* A lot of the rhetoric around giving people opportunities seems inconsistent with the claim that adversity and overcoming it is partially responsible for success
* Maybe the cultural legacies of individualism are responsible for some of the hard-working success
* The way it lands is "you didn't build that", just because it shows the importance of environmental and developmental factors in a person's success and achievement.
* The thing I really dislike about this book is that it seems to discount the value of individual effort.

* Why does the fact that white men are disproportionately in CEO roles undoubtedly reflective of some kind of unconscious bias?

{% comment %}
HIGH-LEVEL NOTES
* Good can only come from good and bad can only come for bad
* Sloppy use of "selfish"
* That bad circumstances can't befall a good person; lots of unqualified characterizations like that
* Body obeys the mind. But maybe it's actually more integrated or reciprocal.
* Suffering is only a product of bad thinking or dispositions
* Chapter 5: rejects dichotomy of oppressor and oppressed, with freedom being the answer. A perfect compassion is for both master and slave. They do it to themselves as much as they do it to each other.
* I can see why _As a Man Thinketh_ would be triggering for people who are stuck in the paradigm of abuser-victim/oppressor-oppressed/master-slave/exploiter-exploited. They are trapped in a world of "us" versus "them". Somebody has to be the bad guy. Always look outward for explanations for your circumstances. (The irony is that they can't conceive of it in consistent terms.)
* bad uses of "selfish" and "sacrifice", and unclear uses of "holy" and "sinful" (secular metaphor or religious idea?)

HIGH-LEVEL NOTES
* fundamental unit (gene versus individual lifeform) depends on context. For philosophy, it's the choice-making entity. For biology, it can be the gene. What about group of individuals? (related also to equivocation on "selfishness")
* Iterated prisoner's dilemma has to be not envious, but that's not compatible with the altruist ethics he argues for.
* Iterated prisoner's dilemma "rational mathematician" discounts role of subconscious integration. Doesn't require exploitation at end of life.
* WWI example demonstrates individual choices being better than coordinated activities. Opposite of what some people say we need government to do things individuals wouldn't.

* Anecdote about nuts before dinner putting off appetite and removal of choices and contrast between economics and human decision-making
* Doesn't acknowledge the role of people relying on others' expertise as a factor for being influenced by "peer pressure"
* Doesn't attribute housing crisis to government intervention in the first place, then says market can't fix all of it.
* Requirements on credit card companies to allow payment in full automatically each month is not an example of libertarian paternalism. That's just statism.
* Does not understand externalities or transaction costs
* Thinks that badly aligned incentives justify government action
* How is the right to contract for a waiver of suit for medical malpractice any different in principle from credit card companies being able to offer whatever plans they want for automatic payment?
* Creates a total straw man for the rights to be wrong and how people learn
* Attitudes about redistribution are the not libertarian attitude
* Equates being against redistribution with wanting to be better off than other people
* "forcing people to choose" !?

* How to think, not what to think. Relationship to growth versus fixed mindset. Relationship to fact and value.
* assumes college is even a good idea
* again, he betrays a hilariously traditional/conservative/outmoded anti-homosexual bias...he's pretty good about double-standards, but it's pretty funny
* interesting views about sexual liberation
* "gays and drugs" LOL

HIGH-LEVEL THOUGHTS
* really interesting mentions of homosexuality, sometimes in terms of deriding the "just an alternative lifestyle" and in how he talks about the various political agendas (which he's basically right about, but the way he talks about it betrays his emotional biases)
* interesting how strict he is in terms of judicial role in interpreting the Constitution, particularly with respect to application of constraints on the Federal government to the states, since that was the result of "judicial activism". But substantively, philosophically, that's absolutely correct, just not politically possible when the country was founded.

* glorification of equality is not the same thing as rejecting authority. Equivocation on "authority". Independent judgment and its cultivation in children requires developmentally appropriate ways of having them validate moral rules and knowledge in general independently and not just accept what is handed to them by parents or teachers. Use of phrase "Parental authority" is way too fuzzy and then equates "obey when there isn't time" (like running into street) and abiding by destructive social norms.

SOME HIGH-LEVEL NOTES
* I resent having to engage in more than stage one thinking, which is why we have philosophical principles to provide guidance. I thought of this when listening to the section on the various implications of land use restrictions and how that can be manipulated by people to increase the value of their own land, and that all seems so horrifically devious. None of that would even occur to me when trying to decide on the justice of a particular policy, since I would always think about it in terms of principles. The point is to make sure that the principles are formed inductively by understanding beyond stage one thinking.
* Interesting attitude about immigration, which he seems ambivalent about.
* Really good differentiation between bias, racism, prejudice.

* A great reinforcement of a ton of stuff I already knew, both explicitly and implicitly, and a very cogent and well structured connection of theory to practice.
* Atomic habits: systems versus goals; same as my "goal-oriented is process-oriented"
* If we use a reward/punishment mechanism to make something pleasant/unpleasant in a little way to help establish/break a habit, what if that particular thing you use actually itself reinforces a bad disposition, such as caring what others think / approval/disapproval from others?
* Habit Tracking. LOL. I can't fucking believe that therapist Phillip was encouraging me to break that. Fuck that noise.
* Chapter 18 Big 5:
  * openness to experience: curious/inventive versus cautious/consistent
  * conscientiousness: organized/efficient versus easy-going/spontaneous
  * extroversion: outgoing/energetic versus solitary/reserved

CAPTURING SOME HIGH-LEVEL NOTES I JOTTED DOWN
* SMS to a friend:
  * Overall, I liked it, but I struggled to grasp what the main thesis was. I found valuable the illustration of overcoming severe adversity, helping to put into perspective my own challenges and reminding me very concretely that I, too, can overcome them. It was also interesting as a historical account (though I'm quite tired in general of the Jews-as-victims theme, even if you can argue here that it's precisely that he was NOT a victim). But while he kept giving lip service to (and briefly mentioning) how meaning is not inherently about suffering and overcoming it, that was the overall impression and feeling that I was left with: Life is suffering, and making meaning in life is about living well, despite the suffering. I don't know whether that's really his view or what he was trying to say, but that struck me pretty hard throughout. And I can't tell you how much every atom of my being rebels against that idea. Suffering happens, yes, and I make a big point about how depression--far from needing to be pathologized--is a normal part of the human experience. But the essence of life is joy and happiness, and I think that life is THAT, perhaps punctuated by occasional bouts of suffering. And yes, we need tools for dealing with that suffering, with dignity and grace and skill, but it's not the suffering that gives life meaning; it's the joy that gives life meaning. I understand why Frankl fixates on suffering and what value he derived from it; he suffered a tremendous amount, more than the "punctuation" I mentioned. And while he said numerous times how he found opportunities for joy (my characterization), which I think could have been made much more clear as one of the central theses in the book, in the end, he still focused on the overall phenomenon as "meaning from suffering". I don't think that I'm just getting fixated on the word use, either (the way I often do with the word "selfish"), but even if I am, then my concern remains in terms of what message he might end up sending to most readers.
  * Now, applying to my current situation: I am suffering about this whole Adam thing more than I ever knew I could suffer. And frankly, I don't yet know what meaning to make of it. Sure, there are lessons here and there, but even looking at it through Frankl's framework, I think I have absolutely conducted myself with dignity and grace, with my head held high. I know I always did my best. I did not allow my despair to result in a lessening of my standards for how I would treat Adam or anybody else, no matter how unjust it all felt. So great...except I still don't know what my lesson is in this whole experience, whatever superficial things it feels like I have learned. Maybe that will take time. Or maybe I will never know. And either is "okay". But I don't feel like the suffering here is what gives my life meaning. The meaning I have created for my life is a meaning that persists _despite_ what I've gone through with Adam. And indeed, it was so much the love we shared, the life we built and were continuing to build, that gave my life a lot of meaning. (And now all of that is gone.) Is it all of life's meaning? No. But it was huge. I can't ever imagine thinking that enduring the suffering of the last year or two is what gave or gives my life meaning.
  * Again, I don't think this contradicts Frankl's viewpoint, but it certainly differs from the main thrust of what landed with me about the book.

* attributes to human nature the results of experiments that could just be reflecting dominant cultural trends that are result of philosophy, not basic psychology.
* Basically typical/common human cognitive biases. But he draws/recommends some invalid conclusions (about capitalism / markets), and his use of "irrational" and "rational" ends up being really equivocal and all-or-nothing, premised on a standard of "perfection" that he also undermines.
* Doesn't inquire what might be operative for outliers from his dominant experimental results.
* Defines rationality and optimums and value judgments based on non-human characteristics, then says humans are irrational for not pursuing objective values.
* 3/4 into chapter 9: very kantian
* Good point about placebos and that it actually creates value
* Nonsense about honesty
* Lauding SOX!? Okay, he backs down from that when he mentions the costs.
* Summary to friend:
  * There are a lot of very interesting observations and raw material for being aware of common cognitive biases, but a lot of the conclusions he draws (particularly when he starts making policy recommendations) are...well...irrational.
  * The errors he makes in his reasoning are actual failures of logic, sometimes known logical fallacies.
  * Definitely a good way of being more mindful of my own motivations and biases, rather than mostly fixating on my known susceptibility to sunken cost fallacy.
* Another summary: I'd say a fundamental error is in how he defines rationality and irrationality, particularly in that he's very inconsistent in its use. It's not that I'm fixating on a particular definition...it's that he ends up contradicting himself. And then there's one place where he redeems himself (in the chapter on placebos), but then fails to apply that understanding more holistically.
* interestingly, ariely wants to impugn market economics, despite its superior track record. Why not acknowledge that we need to get there first, then see if there's some further optimization?
