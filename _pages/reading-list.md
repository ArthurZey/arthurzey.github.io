Let's just say that I use the word "read" loosely: I include here audiobooks that I've listened to, but I'm not including podcasts or one-off audio productions (such as recorded lectures).

Not up to date (yet?), but see also [my Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/arthurzey){:target="&lowbar;blank"} and my [my Audible Listener Page](https://www.audible.com/listener/A21N9AKRB4509R){:target="&lowbar;blank"}.

{% comment %}
HIGH-LEVEL NOTES
* political versus economic versus civic freedom: not clearly explained; oddly described as trichotomy, despite maybe claiming they all have to go hand-in-hand?
* surprising mish-mash of principled and unprincipled thinking; lots of case-by-case thinking, but then trying to reduce some cases to scenarios already solved, but not getting at a fundamental principle
* Public school vouchers... Very unprincipled approach

HIGH-LEVEL NOTES

## Thomas Sowell: _Choosing a College_
[Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B002VAEZC6){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
{% comment %}
HIGH-LEVEL THOUGHTS
* interesting comments about "neutrality" and "intolerance" with respect to bias and teaching "both sides" of an issue...only applies to humanities, apparently. can't imagine he would advocate the same for flat-earth theory as for Marxism
* How to think, not what to think. Relationship to growth versus fixed mindset. Relationship to fact and value.
* assumes college is even a good idea
* again, he betrays a hilariously traditional/conservative/outmoded anti-homosexual bias...he's pretty good about double-standards, but it's pretty funny
* interesting views about sexual liberation
* "gays and drugs" LOL
* discusses philosophy as an easy/unserious discipline
{% endcomment %}

## Thomas Sowell: _Compassion Versus Guilt and Other Essays_
[Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B002V8KK2M){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
{% comment %}
HIGH-LEVEL THOUGHTS
* really interesting mentions of homosexuality, sometimes in terms of deriding the "just an alternative lifestyle" and in how he talks about the various political agendas (which he's basically right about, but the way he talks about it betrays his emotional biases)
* interesting how strict he is in terms of judicial role in interpreting the Constitution, particularly with respect to application of constraints on the Federal government to the states, since that was the result of "judicial activism". But substantively, philosophically, that's absolutely correct, just not politically possible when the country was founded.

## Thomas Sowell: _A Conflict of Visions_
[Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/B002V1C73Y){:target="&lowbar;blank"} | [Kindle](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B003E749SK/){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
{% comment %}
HIGH-LEVEL THOUGHTS
* Constrained: law doesn't enforce morality, but enables man to be moral
* Unconstrained: law enforces morality directly
* Constrained in the non-integrated, non-automatized sense of morality (so need to deal with short-term incentives)
* Objectivism is unconstrained in its view of human nature; constrained in its economics?
* "people generally doing the best they can" is unconstrained?

{% comment %}
* glorification of equality is not the same thing as rejecting authority. Equivocation on "authority". Independent judgment and its cultivation in children requires developmentally appropriate ways of having them validate moral rules and knowledge in general independently and not just accept what is handed to them by parents or teachers. Use of phrase "Parental authority" is way too fuzzy and then equates "obey when there isn't time" (like running into street) and abiding by destructive social norms.
* Discussion about peace and whether we should see others as people like us. Connection to believing people are doing the best they can.

{% comment %}
SOME HIGH-LEVEL NOTES
* I resent having to engage in more than stage one thinking, which is why we have philosophical principles to provide guidance. I thought of this when listening to the section on the various implications of land use restrictions and how that can be manipulated by people to increase the value of their own land, and that all seems so horrifically devious. None of that would even occur to me when trying to decide on the justice of a particular policy, since I would always think about it in terms of principles. The point is to make sure that the principles are formed inductively by understanding beyond stage one thinking.
* Interesting attitude about immigration, which he seems ambivalent about.
* Really good differentiation between bias, racism, prejudice.

SOME HIGH-LEVEL NOTES
* speculation is different from gambling because it manages risk that is inherent in other economic activity, whereas gambling creates risk were none existed before.
* fails to differentiate between short-term and long-term rationality, and short-term and long-term interests, particularly with respect to the composition fallacy

CAPTURING SOME HIGH-LEVEL NOTES I JOTTED DOWN
* chapter 7 purpose altruism sigh
* how applicable are short-term conformity studies to people who have grit? These can seem at odds with one another.
* talking about success and failure as irrelevant, whereas courage and grit are important (quoting Wooden, I think), and how this is equivocating on success and failure. It's about long term and short term, it's about process versus immediate result / overly identifying with ultimate goal. After all, courage and grit are valuable BECAUSE they lead to ultimate success.
* interesting point about identity (eg, "I am a person who never misses a workout") and meditation's counseling against that (eg, "I am a meditator"). Needs to be disentangled. Post on its own

CAPTURING SOME HIGH-LEVEL NOTES I JOTTED DOWN (chapters are Audible chapters, not book chapters)
* Chapter 3: perception of value based on reports' aesthetic appeal is perfectly rational. It gives you a good indication of the company.
* Tindr swipe is good because physical attractiveness matters
* Regulation of subliminal messaging
* Our not knowing what our subconscious is responding to: why is that a problem? What is he confessing?
* Chapter 5: food choices when ordering on screen: has a strong paternalistic streak
* considerations for paternalism:
  * vicious cycle around treating people as "systematically irrational"
  * smuggling in ethical framework (eg, health care, value judgments about what to encourage/discourage, "social costs")

CAPTURING SOME HIGH-LEVEL NOTES I JOTTED DOWN
* A great reinforcement of a ton of stuff I already knew, both explicitly and implicitly, and a very cogent and well structured connection of theory to practice.
* Atomic habits: systems versus goals; same as my "goal-oriented is process-oriented"
* If we use a reward/punishment mechanism to make something pleasant/unpleasant in a little way to help establish/break a habit, what if that particular thing you use actually itself reinforces a bad disposition, such as caring what others think / approval/disapproval from others?
* Habit Tracking. LOL. I can't fucking believe that therapist Phillip was encouraging me to break that. Fuck that noise.
* Chapter 18 Big 5:
  * openness to experience: curious/inventive versus cautious/consistent
  * conscientiousness: organized/efficient versus easy-going/spontaneous
  * extroversion: outgoing/energetic versus solitary/reserved
  * agreeableness: friendly/compassionate versus challenging/detached
  * neuroticism: anxious/sensitive versus confident/calm/stable

* Chapter 4 process versus outcomes
* Chapter 7: determinism; metaphysically given
* Chapter 14: gratitude, motives around it
* Shame around comparative suffering
* Altruist false dichotomy: finding ways to serve others, self-centered expectations other will serve you
* At least mentions enlightened selfishness
* Chapter 19: about religion and philosophy; alright, now
* [Motte and bailey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy) about what he calls religion

## Viktor Frankl: _Man's Search for Meaning_

CAPTURING SOME HIGH-LEVEL NOTES I JOTTED DOWN
* SMS to a friend:
  * Overall, I liked it, but I struggled to grasp what the main thesis was. I found valuable the illustration of overcoming severe adversity, helping to put into perspective my own challenges and reminding me very concretely that I, too, can overcome them. It was also interesting as a historical account (though I'm quite tired in general of the Jews-as-victims theme, even if you can argue here that it's precisely that he was NOT a victim). But while he kept giving lip service to (and briefly mentioning) how meaning is not inherently about suffering and overcoming it, that was the overall impression and feeling that I was left with: Life is suffering, and making meaning in life is about living well, despite the suffering. I don't know whether that's really his view or what he was trying to say, but that struck me pretty hard throughout. And I can't tell you how much every atom of my being rebels against that idea. Suffering happens, yes, and I make a big point about how depression--far from needing to be pathologized--is a normal part of the human experience. But the essence of life is joy and happiness, and I think that life is THAT, perhaps punctuated by occasional bouts of suffering. And yes, we need tools for dealing with that suffering, with dignity and grace and skill, but it's not the suffering that gives life meaning; it's the joy that gives life meaning. I understand why Frankl fixates on suffering and what value he derived from it; he suffered a tremendous amount, more than the "punctuation" I mentioned. And while he said numerous times how he found opportunities for joy (my characterization), which I think could have been made much more clear as one of the central theses in the book, in the end, he still focused on the overall phenomenon as "meaning from suffering". I don't think that I'm just getting fixated on the word use, either (the way I often do with the word "selfish"), but even if I am, then my concern remains in terms of what message he might end up sending to most readers.
  * Now, applying to my current situation: I am suffering about this whole Adam thing more than I ever knew I could suffer. And frankly, I don't yet know what meaning to make of it. Sure, there are lessons here and there, but even looking at it through Frankl's framework, I think I have absolutely conducted myself with dignity and grace, with my head held high. I know I always did my best. I did not allow my despair to result in a lessening of my standards for how I would treat Adam or anybody else, no matter how unjust it all felt. So great...except I still don't know what my lesson is in this whole experience, whatever superficial things it feels like I have learned. Maybe that will take time. Or maybe I will never know. And either is "okay". But I don't feel like the suffering here is what gives my life meaning. The meaning I have created for my life is a meaning that persists _despite_ what I've gone through with Adam. And indeed, it was so much the love we shared, the life we built and were continuing to build, that gave my life a lot of meaning. (And now all of that is gone.) Is it all of life's meaning? No. But it was huge. I can't ever imagine thinking that enduring the suffering of the last year or two is what gave or gives my life meaning.
  * Again, I don't think this contradicts Frankl's viewpoint, but it certainly differs from the main thrust of what landed with me about the book.

* attributes to human nature the results of experiments that could just be reflecting dominant cultural trends that are result of philosophy, not basic psychology.
* Basically typical/common human cognitive biases. But he draws/recommends some invalid conclusions (about capitalism / markets), and his use of "irrational" and "rational" ends up being really equivocal and all-or-nothing, premised on a standard of "perfection" that he also undermines.
* Doesn't inquire what might be operative for outliers from his dominant experimental results.
* Defines rationality and optimums and value judgments based on non-human characteristics, then says humans are irrational for not pursuing objective values.
* 3/4 into chapter 9: very kantian
* Good point about placebos and that it actually creates value
* Nonsense about honesty
* Lauding SOX!? Okay, he backs down from that when he mentions the costs.
* Summary to friend:
  * There are a lot of very interesting observations and raw material for being aware of common cognitive biases, but a lot of the conclusions he draws (particularly when he starts making policy recommendations) are...well...irrational.
  * The errors he makes in his reasoning are actual failures of logic, sometimes known logical fallacies.
  * Definitely a good way of being more mindful of my own motivations and biases, rather than mostly fixating on my known susceptibility to sunken cost fallacy.
* Another summary: I'd say a fundamental error is in how he defines rationality and irrationality, particularly in that he's very inconsistent in its use. It's not that I'm fixating on a particular definition...it's that he ends up contradicting himself. And then there's one place where he redeems himself (in the chapter on placebos), but then fails to apply that understanding more holistically.
* interestingly, ariely wants to impugn market economics, despite its superior track record. Why not acknowledge that we need to get there first, then see if there's some further optimization?
