### The Good Thing
I finishing auditing all my dental claims.
### What It Means to Me
I'm finally done with a major health care claim auditing project that's been weighing on me for years, and I now have peace of mind that everything is (or will soon be) in order. It's important to me that claims are processed correctly and that I am getting reimbursed the correct amount by my health care plans.
### What It Says about Me
I'm organized and fastidious. I care about justice. I'm on top of things.

### The Good Thing
1FROG was very enjoyable. I got to play with a friend's kid. We had enjoyable discussion about _America's Revolutionary Mind_. The company was very pleasant.
### What It Means to Me
I really enjoy stimulating intellectual discussion and having a baseline of shared philosophic values in a friend group, which can make even relatively superficial conversation all the more pleasant. Playing with my friend's kid and getting along well with him reflects my love of children.
### What It Says about Me
I'm interested in philosophic ideas and a nerd. I'm establishing a friend group in Colorado and putting down roots. I'm gonna be a good dad when I have my own kids.
