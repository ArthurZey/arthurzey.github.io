### The Good Thing
I had a really enjoyable date, for which I cooked steak, and in total, we ended up talking about really engaging topics for about 7 hours.
### What It Means to Me
I really enjoy spending time with and getting to know people who are also careful, critical thinkers, who are interested in similar ideas, and who are simultaneously excited to share and also to listen.
### What It Says about Me
Meaningful connections are important to me. I'm getting progressively more comfortable with dating again.

### The Good Thing
I went snowboarding for the first time this season at Breckenridge and did mostly black-diamond moguls for about 5 hours.
### What It Means to Me
I love snowboarding and being in the Colorado mountains. I love the smell of crisp air, and the feeling of sun on and wind in my face. I love the views.
### What It Says about Me
I'm athletic and fit. I have maintained a fair amount of skill since the last season. I feel more and more like a true Coloradan.

### The Good Thing
I finished a bunch of required compliance training at my new job nearly a month before the deadline.
### What It Means to Me
I'm getting better at not procrastinating. I'm learning to take care of "important" things that aren't urgent. I've knocked out a piece of hateful administrative overhead that would otherwise weigh on my mind until I finally did it.
### What It Says about Me
I'm getting better at staying on top of things. I'm responsible.

### The Good Thing
1FROG was very enjoyable. I got to play with a friend's kid. We had enjoyable discussion about _America's Revolutionary Mind_. The company was very pleasant.
### What It Means to Me
I really enjoy stimulating intellectual discussion and having a baseline of shared philosophic values in a friend group, which can make even relatively superficial conversation all the more pleasant. Playing with my friend's kid and getting along well with him reflects my love of children.
### What It Says about Me
I'm interested in philosophic ideas and am a nerd. I'm establishing a friend group in Colorado and putting down roots. I'm gonna be a good dad when I have my own kids.

## 2021-11-20
### The Good Thing
I finishing auditing all my dental claims.
### What It Means to Me
I'm finally done with a major health care claim auditing project that's been weighing on me for years, and I now have peace of mind that everything is (or will soon be) in order. It's important to me that claims are processed correctly and that I am getting reimbursed the correct amount by my health care plans.
### What It Says about Me
I'm organized and fastidious. I care about justice. I'm on top of things.
