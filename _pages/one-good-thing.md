I got a Christmas tree!
### What It Means to Me
I freakin' love Christmas and the smell of Christmas trees (particularly Douglas firs), and their existence in my proximity brings me joy.
### What It Says about Me
Frankly, I'm not really sure...maybe that I can easily derive joy from things?


## 2021-12-08
Got to write a really nice email response to a really nice email I had received.
### What It Means to Me
It feels really good for someone to have expressed gratitude for the work I'd done and value I created, and I enjoyed being able to write a response that reciprocated that gratitude, and in particular, being able to articulate why, despite some differences in viewpoints, we managed to work through that and not let those difference stand in the way of our doing good work together.
### What It Says about Me
I've been getting better and better with time connecting with people and practicing compassion and empathy, being willing to understand and hear their viewpoints without succumbing to the pressure I feel to offer my own judgments, and being able to work productively with them by not taking those differences out of context.


## 2021-12-07
The plumber came and addressed two pressing issues we've been having for a few months.

## 2021-12-06
I did four sets of 6 bodyweight chinups, despite lower-back pain.
### What It Means to Me
I've been delaying getting back into a lifting routine, partially based on lots of (relatively reasonable) excuses, and the latest is that my back was really sore from overdoing it snowboarding on Saturday. I've been wanting to get back to lifting, but I've also been making the perfect the enemy of the good by not doing anything if I couldn't have a "proper" planned-out routine. So I'm pleased that I overcame that and started doing _something_, if only to shake myself out of this funk.
### What It Says about Me
I'm getting better at being able to pursue values in an incremental way, rather than succumbing to "black-or-white" thinking. I'm being more consistent about pursuing my passion for physical fitness and bodybuilding.

## 2021-12-05
I had a really enjoyable date, for which I cooked steak, and in total, we ended up talking about really engaging topics for about 7 hours.
### What It Means to Me
I really enjoy spending time with and getting to know people who are also careful, critical thinkers, who are interested in similar ideas, and who are simultaneously excited to share and also to listen.
### What It Says about Me
Meaningful connections are important to me. I'm getting progressively more comfortable with dating again.

## 2021-12-04
I went snowboarding for the first time this season at Breckenridge and did mostly black-diamond moguls for about 5 hours.
### What It Means to Me
I love snowboarding and being in the Colorado mountains. I love the smell of crisp air, and the feeling of sun on and wind in my face. I love the views.
### What It Says about Me
I'm athletic and fit. I have maintained a fair amount of skill since the last season. I feel more and more like a true Coloradan.

## 2021-12-03
I finished a bunch of required compliance training at my new job nearly a month before the deadline.
### What It Means to Me
I'm getting better at not procrastinating. I'm learning to take care of "important" things that aren't urgent. I've knocked out a piece of hateful administrative overhead that would otherwise weigh on my mind until I finally did it.
### What It Says about Me
I'm getting better at staying on top of things. I'm responsible.

## 2021-12-02

I joined my friend Sasha for Thanksgiving dinner at her mom's house.

I completed most of my Amazon deboarding activities.
### What It Means to Me
It felt good to clear my mind of so much that I had to do to wrap things up at Amazon, since a ton of thing had been nagging at my subconscious.
### What It Says about Me
I have a strong sense of ownership and responsibility, particularly in that I wasn't willing to just drop things, but instead set my soon-to-be-former teammates up for success after my departure.


## 2021-11-23
I got to pet Murray!

## 2021-11-22
I knocked out a bunch of errands early, before my first meeting of the morning, including finishing the registration of my car in Colorado.
### What It Means to Me
It felt really good to be so productive so early in the morning, particularly things that felt like hateful administrative overhead ("adulting").
### What It Says about Me
I'm responsible and on top of things. Now that I have my car registered in Colorado, I'm that much closer to being a real Coloradan.


## 2021-11-21
1FROG was very enjoyable. I got to play with a friend's kid. We had enjoyable discussion about _America's Revolutionary Mind_. The company was very pleasant.
### What It Means to Me
I really enjoy stimulating intellectual discussion and having a baseline of shared philosophic values in a friend group, which can make even relatively superficial conversation all the more pleasant. Playing with my friend's kid and getting along well with him reflects my love of children.
### What It Says about Me
I'm interested in philosophic ideas and am a nerd. I'm establishing a friend group in Colorado and putting down roots. I'm gonna be a good dad when I have my own kids.

## 2021-11-20
I finishing auditing all my dental claims.
### What It Means to Me
I'm finally done with a major health care claim auditing project that's been weighing on me for years, and I now have peace of mind that everything is (or will soon be) in order. It's important to me that claims are processed correctly and that I am getting reimbursed the correct amount by my health care plans.
### What It Says about Me
I'm organized and fastidious. I care about justice. I'm on top of things.
