## 2021-03-14

I got a text message from Adam yesterday for the first time since I reached out to him in December on the anniversary of our meeting. He needed some tax documents and commented on a few other things I don't want to get into here. I responded later that evening, and the whole experience was horrifically dysregulating, involving lots of crying and grief and confusion. I'm hoping we can talk (which he indicated an openness to), but I don't know what I'd want to get out of it. I don't know that it's wise for us to try again or that a relationship between us is likely to work out. I don't know that there's anything that I can say or do that would be useful. I don't know that in what will likely be a tense and anxiety-inducing experience, I can learn anything explicitly that I will be able to take at face value. So maybe I'm just craving reconnection, to know that he's okay, maybe to get some indication that he still values what we had and is grieving its loss (_because it fucking means something, damn it_). But I also can't shake the feeling that if we _really_ try and _really_ do the work, we can capitalize on our love for one another and recreate all the joy and happiness that we experienced and found so easily, once upon a time. I just find myself feeling that I don't accept the logic of any argument that says it's impossible for things to work out or that we're inherently a bad match. Yes, there would be difficulties to overcome, but to say it's _impossible_ seems like maintaining a fixed mindset and writing people off. I can say something is unlikely (or that the effort is not worth it), but I really feel like if we could just go through the logic of it--the logic of our love for one another and what it would take to make things work--we could absolutely find a way. We just have to be willing. The irony is that, on the one hand, I'm rejecting psychological determinism by maintaining a growth mindset about him and us; on the other hand, I'm maintaining psychological determinism by believing that someone's mind can be changed if only they heard exactly the right argument or combination of words. All the while, It's hard to think that the Adam I fell in love with doesn't exist, and maybe I'm chasing a ghost. I don't know. So I'm trying to get a grip so that it doesn't completely derail things I need to get done. Fuck.

"Sucking it up" and "pulling it together", despite still feeling a bit like repression, seems to have helped get me out of a funk. I've been more enthusiastic about stuff at work (a really cool project I'm working on that's also critically important for my career growth and success). And my sex drive has increased again, and I'm feeling more myself in that regard.

I have noticed, however, that my "repression experiment" is approaching the limits of its sustainability. I'm feeling how my grief about losing Adam and Billy (and [fucking _everything else_](#2021-01-20)) is vying for my attention at the periphery of my awareness. And I'm increasingly easily triggered by themes in TV shows and certain kinds of music. (Without giving away any spoilers, [s01e08 of _WandaVision_](https://trakt.tv/shows/wandavision/seasons/1/episodes/8){:target="&lowbar;blank"} had me desperately wanting to drive out to Fairplay and sit on the property where Adam and I were going to build our future home, and just cry my guts out.) I have more of a sense of [everything will be okay](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5R0Rkutvvfh4Bt8wpGRvQ5){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, but I still find myself breaking down a few times a week, weepy, and then I have to "suck it up" again. I'm wondering whether just making sure that I have _some_ space for that is good enough of a pressure valve for releasing the grief.

Meanwhile, I'm working on overcoming my severe sense of feeling overwhelmed, drowning in administrative overhead that's really the result of irresponsibility and failure to adult effectively. Thanks to the support of my friend Vicki, we're now doing "parallel play" as often as our schedules allow, where Vicki comes over to my house, and we just knock out otherwise-hateful administrative tasks. Surprisingly, these tasks felt less hateful in this context, and I found myself looking forward to the time together, getting things done. It helped me to feel less anxious about the mountain of crap I keep putting off leading up to the session, and then I got into a state of quasi-flow even after she left, allowing me to maintain the momentum of the productivity. So that's pretty good.

I also find myself a little bit more resilient to "micro-disasters", including some unpleasantness that's been gnawing at me in the last few days, where someone in a training/support group I'm in is unintentionally and unknowingly trying to drag me into drama. I don't think she has a single malicious bone in her body, but the way she has been approaching me about things she finds unpleasant about our interactions reflects a deep wound and severe emotional and behavioral dysregulation, all of which is ultimately very unpleasant for me. And after numerous attempts at getting on better footing, I already see how there's nothing I can do within the bounds of truth and authenticity to help improve the situation or her experience. And so I just have to let it go (and I'm definitely disengaging), but I still find myself easily distracted by ruminating over all the hypocrisy and unfairness and tragedy of the situation.

In more pleasant news, I'm starting a new [mesocycle](/physical-fitness/#exercise) today, and I just hope that I can muster up the discipline to consistently go to bed ridiculously early, so that I have enough time for stretching, too, before I start my workdays.

## 2021-02-06

For the last week, thanks to a suggestion in a [cocounseling](https://peaklivingnetwork.org/split-time/){:target="&lowbar;blank"} session, I've been trying an experiment that I'm feeling nervous and cautious about: I'm intentionally directing my focus away from "all my problems" (that I referred to on [January 20](#2021-01-20) and in my [2020 Retrospective](/blog/2021-01-01/2020-retrospective/)) and trying to connect with the feeling of "I'm too good for all this shit, and I refuse to waste my life on it.". This feels risky to me because it smacks of repression and runs counter to all the reasons that [wallowing](/wallowing/) has been very good for me as a way of working through things. Stuffing down unpleasant feelings and not leaning into discomfort when it arises risks [angry outbursts](/anger-management/). But it's an experiment, and I'm willing to try. The gods know I can't continue the way I have been. And maybe, just maybe, my willingness to try this experiment is itself a reflection of having done enough work and processing, so it's possibly more of an organic evolution of my journey than an artificial interference in the working of my emotional immune system.

So far, the results have been _pretty okay_. I feel more even-keeled and less desirous of alcohol as a numbing agent. There's still a lot on my to-do list that's creating subconscious psychological pressure, so I'm still feeling overwhelmed at times, but pushing that away has had the counterintuitive result of feeling freer to have the energy and enthusiasm for other important things, like a work project demanding a lot of cognitive and emotional labor. And I feel more excited about the prospect of getting things done, even though many of the nagging items remain on my to-do list.

We'll see how this goes...

## 2021-01-20

Here's the short of it: I'm currently extremely emotionally dysregulated and depressed. A lot of really crummy shit has happened over the last few years, and it feels like it really intensified at the end of 2020 and is continuing into 2021. I'm not even talking about COVID or anything happening on a cultural/social/political level.

Yes, there are some good things, too, and I'm trying hard to lean into that. But really, I'm just trying to keep it together so that I can do well in my job and take care of my physical/emotional/spiritual health.

You're probably reading this because I sent you a link to explain why I've been so distant and disconnected. Well, I'm sorry about that.

Frankly, I'm just tired of being _that guy_ for whom everything is always awful and doom and gloom. I've been really pessimistic of late. I don't care how much everybody assures me that of course they want to be there for me and they love me. It doesn't matter how much I'd be there for them--for _you_. This isn't a shame thing. I just don't like it. I feel worse unloading the same crappy story on every friend who's concerned about me, and I'm sure part of it is about how I end up feeling mired in my own drama...and that's really saying something, considering how in love I am with my own stories. I also know that once I start spilling, it turns into a torrent.

I'm feeling reclusive. It doesn't mean I don't want to hear from people. It doesn't mean I don't care about you. But I don't want to reach out and vomit my negativity on others. (Yes, I realize the irony of sending you this post, but at least that feels contained.)

And also, I'm sick to death of advice to focus on the positive, practice self-compassion, pursue distractions, stop wallowing, "fuck those people", stop using the techniques that have served me well for decades, and "have you considered anti-depressants"? It's not that these conversations are off the table, so I'm not discouraging you from offering your observations and judgments, since I don't want to presumptuously assume you have no new perspective to offer. But I'm exhausted by the same conversations over and again.

Part of me feels like the universe really did throw a ton of really awful shit at me in a highly concentrated time period; and what's worse, a lot of it has reopened wounds from previous years. So I feel like my sour disposition and misanthropy is somewhat calibrated. But then it's a vicious cycle, because then "minor upsets" feel a lot more magnified, and I feel less equipped to handle them emotionally.

Depending on whether you've interacted with me in the last handful of months, you might find the above somewhat surprising. I _am_ able to enjoy individual activities, conversations, etc. Thank goodness I'm able to lean into moments of joy.

But here's a relatively short inventory of what's weighing me down:
* [continued grief and pain over losing Adam (and Billy) and the future we were building](/blog/2021-01-01/2020-retrospective/#end-of-relationship-with-adam)
* [burglary of my storage unit and loss of my life's memorabilia](/blog/2021-01-01/2020-retrospective/#burglary-of-storage-unit)
* continuing drama associated with State Farm's bad-faith reversal of a liability determination in which _I_ was struck by a speeding vehicle while I was nearly stationary
* end of my friendship with Diana, which happened in a deeply painful and frustrating way and which reopened some wounds from other lost friendships
* my NAS crashing, with 18 TB of data hanging in the balance while I pursue recovery options (even though most of that is backed up to Dropbox)
* Aetna's misprocessing of health care claims, sometimes to the tune of thousands of dollars in individual months, requiring an ongoing and large-scale auditing project on my part
* starting on a new team at Amazon, which, while overall good, demands a lot of emotional energy, to say nothing of the emotional turmoil associated with leaving my previous team
* still struggling to get my footing and feel settled, having moved to Denver in July
* in general, trying to figure out what kind of life I even want to build (eg, having kids and moving to the mountains)

And if you know me at all, you know how much I hate change. And loss. And one-way doors. Fuck.

_(I want to make this crystal clear about some of the bullets above: I regard Adam and Diana as fundamentally good people. I don't plan to say much publicly about the substance of our challenges, but please do not conclude that my pain and loss mean that I believe that they are bad people. Do I wish they would have done some things differently? Sure. I wish that I had done some things differently, too. Everybody was doing the best they could in these difficult situations.)_

And then a million little things, like my key fob slipping off my key ring this week ($50 replacement cost), pulling my back a few weeks ago that interfered with snowboarding and lifting, intensification of chronic knee issues, ongoing sleep apnea issues, blah, blah, blah.

Yes, there are good things, too. But you know, I don't even feel motivated to list them out, even though I'm keeping a daily _Three Good Things_ list. Under "normal" circumstances, I would feel more inclined to celebrate in my successes, but however good these things are (and yeah, some of them are pretty good), I'm just too exhausted and overwhelmed.

I started drafting a [2020 Retrospective](/blog/2021-01-01/2020-retrospective/), where I go more in depth on some of these things, but I'm struggling to find the emotional fortitude to make progress and complete it. But it might be of interest if you want more detail.

Coming back to the main point, I guess: I'm forcing myself to get out of bed in the morning because consciousness is agony, and I'm dreading falling asleep at night because I often have severe nightmares about things from real life (mostly about Adam). And so it's hard for me to even think about connecting with people. I do care about what's going on in your life, but I know that if I reach out, I'm just going to go on and on about all the negative stuff that's going on with me, even if you don't ask about it. (Fuck--look at what I just did here with what was supposed to be a short blurb.) It doesn't even matter much whether things are going well for you (which I hope they are) or if you're going through some similar struggles (which could maybe help me to feel like you really get me)--I'm tired of being a broken record. The context is different, but I like Brené Brown's framing of "not being fit for human consumption". That's how I feel right now, and that's closely tied to why I haven't posted or engaged on Facebook for nearly a year and a half. By and large, I feel like I need to get to some place of peace and stability and equanimity, largely on my own, and then I'll feel better equipped to connect with people more regularly. Please, spare me the lectures about how we're wired for connection and how we best heal together; I'm doing a lot of [cocounseling](https://peaklivingnetwork.org/split-time/){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, and I hope that that can help.

For now, things feel dark and dismal. You don't have to do anything differently with respect to quantity of communication, but please do be mindful of some of the ways in which I'm sensitive that I've given an indication of above. (Regardless, I promise I won't be upset with you if you're not "perfect" on that score.) **More than anything, please know that my not reaching out does not reflect some lack of care or interest.** I'm just worn out. Please be patient with me.
