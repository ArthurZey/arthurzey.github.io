# Preparation
1. The evening before cooking, cut the rack(s) of ribs into pieces that fit into your Pyrex pan(s) and arrange them so that they don't overlap and there is at least a centimeter or two between the top of the ribs and the top of the pan.
2. Salt, pepper, and season both sides of all pieces and rub the seasoning in.
3. Cover the Pyrex pan(s) tightly with foil and put in fridge overnight.
4. As early as you can muster the next morning, start heating the oven to about 215°F (sea level) to 230°F (at about a mile elevation).
5. Fill the pan(s) with water, so that it just barely covers the ribs. For a typical rack of ribs, cut into two pieces in an 11"x17" pan, that's about 2 cups of water.
6. Tighten the foil on the Pyrex pan(s) again, and put the pan(s) in the oven. Set a timer for at least 10 hours.
7. Check the oven every 3 hours to make sure the water hasn't boiled off. It's okay if the tops of the ribs are a bit exposed, but if more than half of the ribs are above the water line, refill with more water. (If the foil is tight enough, you should not have to add any water throughout the entire cooking process.)
8. After your 10-hour timer goes off, reduce the oven temperature to minimum, if you want to keep remaining ribs warm while you begin to chow down. Otherwise, turn the oven off and remove ribs.\\
