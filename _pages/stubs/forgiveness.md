What is forgiveness? What is "accepting an apology"? What does it mean to "forgive and forget"? What is "holding a grudge"? What is "letting something go"?

I want to take a look at these questions from two complementary perspectives: philosophical and psychological. Philosophically, I want to examine moral agency and moral accountability, especially through an egoistic (Objectivist) lens. Psychologically, I want to examine the related issues of performative/ritualistic behaviors (eg, "I'm sorry.", "That's okay.", "I accept your apology.", apology symmetry), the cognitive costs and benefits of rumination versus evasion, and wholeheartedness/authenticity.
