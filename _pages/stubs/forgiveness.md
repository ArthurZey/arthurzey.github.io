What is forgiveness? What is "accepting an apology"? What does it mean to "forgive and forget"? What is "holding a grudge"? What is "letting something go"?

I want to take a look at these questions from two complementary perspectives: philosophical and psychological. Philosophically, I want to examine moral agency and moral accountability, especially through an egoistic (Objectivist) lens. Psychologically, I want to examine the related issues of performative/ritualistic behaviors (eg, "I'm sorry.", "That's okay.", "I accept your apology.", apology symmetry), the cognitive costs and benefits of rumination versus evasion, and wholeheartedness/authenticity.

Related to apologizing, I want to explore some topics related to my personal growth:

Being able to apologize as readily as I can now is not something that came naturally to me. I think the operative factors earlier in my life were feelings of righteous indignation and equity. But over time, the logic of "the supreme sanctity of _the truth_" won out. Nowadays, it's very easy for me to accept responsibility for anything I've done wrong, because that's _the truth_. And it has nothing to do with whether anybody else is able to apologize for anything else. Ironically, there's a very narrow and immediate way in which this isn't about the other person or my caring about them or the effect of my apology on them; it's just a matter of personal accountability, an allegiance to reality, and what kind of person I want to be, justice and others' desert be damned. (In reality, these concerns are harmonious, but there's an interesting question of what's _alive_ for me in a given moment of apologizing.)
