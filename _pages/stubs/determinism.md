description: "Volition is self-evident and axiomatic. The universe works by deterministic laws. And yet choice is not an illusion. How is this possible?"

This is a favorite topic of many philosophy students. It's fun to think about. But the most important lesson I've learned about this over the years is that _it doesn't matter_. While I think there are valuable things to learn from engaging in it, this is mostly just a fun intellectual exercise.

This will likely be a post that evolves over time (for a long time), as I continue to refine my articulation and address more angles.

Here are a few things I want to address (and this is by no means exhaustive):

* why volition is self-evident, and that in a contest between that and "hard determinism", why I would side with volition
* what volition is and isn't (and why typical characterizations like "the power to have done otherwise" are illegitimate)
* why I don't like the phrase "free will" (ie, that it implies "contra-causal freedom")
* what choice is and how it can be both deterministic and meaningful (and relatedly, what the role of epistemic ignorance is)
  * different senses of choice; eg, deciding in advance to raise your hand or not versus the choice in the moment of what you do
* connection to whether you can choose your values or decide to believe a lie (eg, can you choose to like chocolate ice cream or that 2+2=4?)
* alternative conceptions of causality and "action action" : "things act in accordance with their natures" :: utilitarianism : virtue ethics
* how understanding how something works (eg, volition, choice, a volcano) does not cause it to stop existing
* the connection between moral accountability/agency and determinism
  * mental incapacity/illness
* how the search for explanatory _reasons_ for people's choices and behaviors is implicitly premised on determinism
* the connection to epistemology, especially induction, concept-formation, and principles
  * why you can't use induction and deduction, which presuppose determinism, to establish non-determinism / randomness
* how causality _must imply_ determinism
* the difference between "random" (metaphysical) and "effectively random" (epistemic)
* how "but quantum mechanics!" is an attempt to rationalize volition while still voiding it of the meaning non-determinists want it to have
  * perhaps delegated to another post, but why you can't use induction or deduction to establish a lack of pattern/determinism (even if you _can_ prove it's impossible to _know_ something)
* consciousness as an _action_ performed by the brain, not a _thing_; brain states as reflective of experiential/mind states; connection to "chemical imbalances" versus unpleasant emotions
* what brain states (eg, "limbic system hijack", "sympathetic activation", "dorsal vagal collapse", intoxication) result in compromised volition and why it makes sense to say things like "he couldn't do _X_", when doing _X_ is typically the result of or is a volitional action
* "could have done otherwise" as a conceptual shorthand, not dissimilar in principle from "having rights"; different senses of "can do A or B"
* how the non-determinist position implies mystical dualism / mind-body dichotomy
* whether AI can have genuine volition, even if it's deterministic
* the evolutionary perspective: at what point did we evolve the gene(s) to be exempt from deterministic physical causality?
* why I don't use the terms "compatibilist" or "compatibilism" to describe myself or my views
* connection to other terms, such as "hard determinism", "soft determinism", "indeterminism", and "self-causation"
* what sense of "determinism" I think Ayn Rand was actually objecting to (and [what I think is misunderstood by many Objectivists](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/determinism.html){:target="&lowbar;blank"})
  * two different meanings of the word "determinism":
    * volition has little causal power over outcomes or to affect the course of a person's life (better called "fatalism", HT Andrew Zey)
      * eg, no matter what career I pursue or how much effort or smarts I invest, I'll end up being poor
      * Naturalism in aesthetics
      * tragic heroes in literature
      * time travel stories where someone goes back in time, and no matter what they do, the outcome remains the same
    * like other phenomena in reality, volition has causal power to effect outcomes and is mechanistically deterministic
      * This view doesn't directly comment on whether volition has causal power, but that's an implication: Since volition is something that happens in reality, of course it can affect how things unfold, the same way that anything in reality can have that power (to greater or lesser extents in various contexts). "Physical determinism" can't both have "fixed points" and "non-fixed points", where arbitrary things like whether I am poor (a "fixed point") are not a function of antecedent factors (the "non-fixed points"). I will be poor or not precisely because of all the things that came before, including the contribution of my volitional power and resultant actions. Under "physical determinism", if I'm going to be poor, there's no such thing as "no matter what I do", because whatever I do is the only thing I could do. It can't be that I have to be poor, but I don't have to do any of the things that lead to it. It's all or nothing.
* maybe some polemics around what prominent cultural figures have to say about it? (meh)
