description: "Volition is self-evident and axiomatic. The universe works by deterministic laws. And yet choice is not an illusion. How is this possible?"

This is a favorite topic of many philosophy students. It's fun to think about. But the most important lesson I've learned about this over the years is that _it doesn't matter_. While I think there are valuable things to learn from engaging in it, this is mostly just a fun intellectual exercise.

This will likely be a post that evolves over time (for a long time), as I continue to refine my articulation and address more angles.

Here are a few things I want to address (and this is by no means exhaustive):

* why volition is self-evident, and that in a contest between that and "hard determinism", why I would side with volition
* what volition is and isn't (and why typical characterizations like "the power to have done otherwise" are illegitimate)
* why I don't like the phrase "free will"
* what choice is and how it can be both deterministic and meaningful (and relatedly, what the role of epistemic ignorance is)
* the connection between moral accountability/agency and determinism
* the connection to epistemology, especially induction and concept-formation
* how "but quantum mechanics!" is an attempt to rationalize volition while still voiding it of the meaning non-determinists want it to have
  * perhaps delegated to another post, but why you can't use induction or deduction to establish a lack of pattern/determinism (even if you _can_ prove it's impossible to _know_ something)
* how the non-determinist position implies mystical dualism / mind-body dichotomy
* why I don't use the terms "compatibilist" or "compatibilism" to describe myself or my views
* what sense of "determinism" I think Ayn Rand was actually objecting to (and [what I think is misunderstood by many Objectivists](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/determinism.html){:target="&lowbar;blank"})
* maybe some polemics around what prominent cultural figures have to say about it? (meh)
