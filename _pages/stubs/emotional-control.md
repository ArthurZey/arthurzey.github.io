description: "There's a lot of equivocation on what it means to be able to control one's emotions. I want to untangle a few different senses of the phrase and offer my views on what I think is possible and healthy: (1) force of will in the moment (impossible), (2) taking specific actions to effect or affect emotions, like self-soothing behaviors or listening to sad music (possible, may be healthy or harmful), and (3) long-term work to recalibrate emotional reactions (possible, most likely healthy if pursued carefully)."
