I wrote this in response to a [friend's Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/sharon.niv/posts/pfbid02bLSZm1F5mRBfUfy8gLtXhiHgVyVrhP6iVArbBLrvLYLifZ26wNUa9YxbhguBanfjl):

I'm reminded of an observation I have about alcoholism:

Without suggesting the particular course any individual ought to take to manage their own life and affairs, when someone who struggles with using alcohol responsibly chooses to abstain entirely, this can be a reflection that they remain in the grips of their alcoholism (or, put less dramatically, that they have still not yet learned how to use it responsibly). Turning away from or avoiding a stimulus is not the same as knowing how to deal with it effectively. (That itself is related to why I always tend to lean into all emotions, including all the unpleasant ones: "The only way past is through.") True mastery of or healing from something like alcoholism is learning how to use it responsibly.

Now look, if someone just doesn't care for alcohol or their unpleasant experiences have made it unappealing, that's a different situation; they are not dealing with temptation in that context, so the alcoholism might have been resolved in a different way.

I hasten to make explicit that abstention may well be an important _part_ or _step_ in overcoming alcoholism, but until one tests one's reaction to using alcohol and seeing whether it remains a negative influence, one likely remains in a sort of limbo, still "being an alcoholic". And then there may be situations where the risks are too great, and the easier path with greatest ROI is to just abstain. While I'm dubious that this is the best course of action, since learning the _general_ skills that cultivate discipline, resilience, and strength pay dividends far beyond one's relationship with alcohol, I certainly wouldn't presume to offer categorical prescriptions for what all people ought to do; people need to figure out their own paths on their own timelines in their own ways.

Bringing it back to desire--

I think there's a striking parallel. So many people have a pathological relationship with desire, where unmet and frustrated expectations lead to all manners of dysregulation and suffering. But it seems simplistic and short-sighted to just get rid of the stimulus (the desire)--the skillful approach, just as what the "anti-desire" philosophies counsel with respect to unpleasant emotions, would be to embrace desire and then learn how to make sure that it manifests in life-affirming ways.
