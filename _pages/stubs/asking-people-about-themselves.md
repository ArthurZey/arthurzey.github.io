* different dispositions
  * asking
    * like to ask
    * dislike to ask
  * being asked
    * like to be asked
    * dislike to be asked
  * telling/volunteer
    * like to tell/volunteer
    * dislike to tell/volunteer
  * being told
    * like to be told
    * dislike to be told
  * different combinations work well together; others less so
  * why this is moralized (connection to cultural rejection of self-interest, glorification of humility, etc?)
  * responsibility of the other person
    * to speak up / articulate their needs/desires
    * assume positive intent and not jump to conclusions (eg, "He's just a self-centered asshole.")
    * self-regulation of emotions
* my own attitudes/dispositions (_not_ my conscious convictions)
  * tend to be very excited about my own things ("in love with my own stories")
  * symmetrically, have a default subconscious expectation that others will share anything they're excited about
  * if others not excited enough to volunteer, implication that it's not worth my interest either
  * others' not volunteering landing subconsciously as implying that they're reserved or private and my not wanting to pry if that could cause them to be uncomfortable (because heck--they might not speak up about their discomfort in sharing, either, and then I'm the asshole who strongarmed them into sharing things)
* When consciously recognizing another's default disposition (eg, not liking to volunteer), I might explicitly ask about them, but then this feels phony, like I'm following a script because I'm supposed to, rather than because I'm genuinely interested (even if I am!).
  * related to banality of small talk?
  * related to my not being people-oriented and instead caring more about facts/ideas/things/tasks?
