description: "What does \"autonomy\" mean in human relationships, and why does it matter?"

I've been thinking about three senses of "autonomy" and how their equivocation can lead to discord:

1. interests are inherently disjoint
2. one chooses to consider/accommodate others' interests
3. one's interests are inherently at least partly a function of others' interests
