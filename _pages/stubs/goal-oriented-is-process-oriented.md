description: "Just as true understanding requires being able to connect abstract concepts back to the concrete observations they came from (and applying to new concrete instances), being goal-oriented requires that one understand the specific actions one needs to take to achieve goals. Psychologically, the day-to-day <i>focus</i> cannot be on the goal, but must instead be on adhering to the process that manifests the requisite actions. A good example is around body morphology goals: One cannot focus on the day-to-day changes on the scale, but must instead focus on adherence to the diet and exercise program designed in service of the goals. The process can then be reevaluated and refined at defined milestones. There are strong connections to having a growth versus fixed mindset, self-esteem versus shame, and guidance versus authority in parenting."

## Notes
* Maybe comment on the connection to product management? Customer-obsession is great, but you need to be thinking about direct customers, not just endusers.
