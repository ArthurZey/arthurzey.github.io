There's a lot to say on this topic, including

* wanting to experience the consequences of my choices
* making sure I still have a signal of something that might be wrong (instead of risking greater injury)
* creating a dependence on pharmaceuticals
* the connection to not numbing emotions
* when I _will_ take drugs
* uncalibrated emotions and "chemical imbalance"
