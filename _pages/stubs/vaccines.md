So much to cover...

* fervor of viewpoint versus actual expertise
* effect of categorical statements, motivated by being pro-science, actually being anti-science and being a major factor in anti-vaxxer nonsense
* vaccines are not a monolithic / black-and-white issue
* default is _not_ do whatever is popular / whatever "all the experts agree" on
* the issue of vaccines is not obvious
* individual health concerns and concern for health of friends/family/coworkers/community
* behavioral versus pharmacological risk management
* prevention versus treatment
* can be pro-vaccine and not want to take/advise a particular vaccine in a particular context
* COVID-19 vaccines in particular
  * risk factors matter
  * lots of rhetoric about how well studied these vaccines are (and yes, we have a huge _n_), but where are the datasets for more granular cohorts to enable informed decisions by people trying to assess their individualized tradeoffs?
  * company "vaccine mandate" policies
  * current climate of fear and dogma
