## In General

* the sense in which it's an "absolute" attribute of cognitive abilities, representing the maximum potential of an individual's mind
  * analogy to height
* IQ testing and its changing over time
* individual relevance
  * one-on-one interactions
  * program admissions
* social relevance
  * trends among various genetic groups (ie, "races")
  * trends among cultural groups
* predictive power
  * success in life
  * happiness
  * lifestyle and health traits

## Personally

* testing history
* why I don't like to share my IQ
  * awe
  * incredulity (including "But such-and-such genius from history had an IQ of only [blah]!")
    * being challenged on veracity of claim
  * looking out for confirmation/disproof in future interactions
  * weird interpersonal dynamics relating to insecurity
  * _Who gives a shit?_ What's relevant is not some abstract number, but what you actually know about my demonstrated cognitive skills.
