* forms of pretense
  * modesty as pretending that one is worse than one actually is (playing oneself down)
  * what people usually call "arrogance" as pretending that one is better than one actually is
* objective self-judgment as an alternative to pretense, rejecting the false dichotomy of modesty versus "arrogance", and how it is a prerequisite of genuine pride
* why "arrogance" and "arrogant" are problematic smears / package deals
* how "pride" is misunderstood (and its disastrous effects)
  * in the sense of others' perceptions/judgments (and how this relates to false self-esteem)
  * in the sense of healthy self-esteem and feeling good about one's accomplishments etc
* modesty as an insidious form of "better than others" or other insecurities
* connection to first- versus second-handedness
