Here are a few of my fixations and particularities (in no particular order) that I intend to explain in greater detail:

* apostrophes
  * "The Bureau of Grammatical Integrity" and the anecdote with Sara Triplett and her parents when we "vandalized" the "WASHER AND DRYER HOOK UPS'" sign
  * for pluralization of acronyms
  * for possessives of words that end in "s" or "z"
* the subjunctive
* serial comma
* punctuation and quotation marks
* punctuation for abbreviations (eg, "eg", "ie", "etc", "Mr", "Dr", "PhD", "Sr")
* nested parentheses
* verbs as nouns (eg, "That's a big ask.")
* nouns as verbs (eg, "Let's solution that.")

* "assume" and "assumption" versus "conclude" and "conclusion"
