Here are a few of my fixations and particularities (in no particular order) that I intend to explain in greater detail:

* apostrophes
* the subjunctive
* serial comma
* punctuation and quotation marks
* punctuation for abbreviations (eg, "eg", "ie", "etc", "Mr", "Dr", "PhD", "Sr")
* nested parentheses
* verbs as nouns (eg, "That's a big ask.")
* nouns as verbs (eg, "Let's solution that.")
* adjectives as nouns (eg, "deliverable")
* noun versus verb compound forms (eg, "setup" versus "set up", "login" versus "log in", "checkin" versus "check-in", "oncall" versus "on-call")
* hyphenates that should be their own words (eg, "usecase", "enduser")
* contranyms (eg, "cleave", "sanction", "practically")
* "begs the question" versus "implies the question"
* "a-whole-nother"
* "PIN number", "ATM machine", "API interface", etc
* "compose" versus "comprise"
* "further" versus "farther"
* "less" versus "fewer"
* "envy" versus "jealousy"
* "objective" versus "universal"
* "subjective" versus "personal"
* "selfish" versus "short-sighted whim pursuit"
* "blog post" versus "blog"; "podcast" versus "podcast episode"; "FAQ" versus "FAQ entry"
* "irregardless", other non-words, and the (d)evolution of language (maybe a separate post in its own right)
* datetime stamps, 24-hour time
* "gods"
* "theater" versus "theatre"
* pronunciation of plural words, such as "basis" versus "base"
* Picard-isms: schedule, issue
* "none are" versus "none is"; "any are" versus "any is"
* singular "they"
* singular "data"

Fun games:

* alterninyms (eg, "Sleep, Shower, and Sundry")
* pluralization (eg, mattropodes)

Other topics:

* Style guides be damned! (Kind of.)
* descriptive versus prescriptive versus objective
* evolution versus devolution
