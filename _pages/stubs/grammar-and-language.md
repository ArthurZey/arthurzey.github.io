Here are a few of my fixations and particularities (in no particular order) that I intend to explain in greater detail:

* apostrophes
* the subjunctive
* serial comma
* punctuation and quotation marks
* punctuation for abbreviations (eg, "eg", "ie", "etc", "Mr", "Dr", "PhD", "Sr")
* nested parentheses
* verbs as nouns (eg, "That's a big ask.")
* nouns as verbs (eg, "Let's solution that.")
* adjectives as nouns (eg, "deliverable")
* noun versus verb compound forms (eg, "setup" versus "set up", "login" versus "log in", "checkin" versus "check-in")
* hyphenates that should be their own words (eg, "usecase", "enduser")
* contranyms (eg, "cleave", "sanction", "practically")
* "begs the question" versus "implies the question"
* "a-whole-nother"
* "PIN number", "ATM machine", "API interface", etc
* "compose" versus "comprise"
* "further" versus "farther"
* "less" versus "fewer"
* "envy" versus "jealousy"
* "objective" versus "universal"
* "subjective" versus "personal"
* "irregardless", other non-words, and the (d)evolution of language (maybe a separate post in its own right)

Fun games:

* alterninyms (eg, Sleep, Shower, and Sundry)
* pluralization (eg, mattropodes)
