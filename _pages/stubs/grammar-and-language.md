Here are a few of my fixations and particularities (in no particular order) that I intend to explain in greater detail:

* apostrophes
* the subjunctive
* serial comma
* punctuation and quotation marks
* punctuation for abbreviations (eg, "eg", "ie", "etc", "Mr", "Dr", "PhD", "Sr")
* nested parentheses
* verbs as nouns (eg, "That's a big ask.")
* nouns as verbs (eg, "Let's solution that.")
* adjectives as nouns (eg, "deliverable")
* noun versus verb compound forms; eg,
  * "setup" versus "set up"
  * "login" versus "log in"
  * "checkin" versus "check-in"
  * "oncall" versus "on-call"
  * "inline" versus "in-line"
* hyphenates that should be their own words (eg, "usecase", "enduser")
* contranyms (eg, "cleave", "sanction", "practically")
* "begs the question" versus "implies the question"
* the "[blah] because [noun phrase]" construction
* "a-whole-nother"
* "PIN number", "ATM machine", "API interface", etc
* "compose" versus "comprise"
* "further" versus "farther"
* "less" versus "fewer"
* "envy" versus "jealousy"
* "assume" and "assumption" versus "conclude" and "conclusion"
* "need" versus "want"
  * the effect of regarding these as being quantitatively on the same spectrum: "strong-enough desire" == "metaphysical requirement", an uncalibrated sense of entitlement
* "facts" versus "opinions"
* "objective" versus "universal"
* "subjective" versus "personal"
* "selfish" versus "short-sighted whim pursuit"
* "judge" versus "condemn"
* "compromise"
* "[collection]" versus "[collection] [item]":
  * "blog post" versus "blog"
  * "podcast" versus "podcast episode"
  * "wiki" versus "wiki page"
  * "JIRA" versus "JIRA issue"
  * "FAQ" versus "FAQ entry"
  * "meme" versus ???
* "irregardless", other non-words, and the (d)evolution of language (maybe a separate post in its own right)
* datetime stamps, 24-hour time
* "gods"
* "theater" versus "theatre"
* pronunciation of plural words, such as
  * "basis" versus "base"
  * "bias" ("bias-ehz" versus "bias-eez")
* Picard-isms: schedule, issue, appreciate
* "none are" versus "none is"; "any are" versus "any is"
* singular "they"
* singular "data"
  * shorthand for "item of data"?
  * connection to "the Borg", "a Borg"
  * contrast/connection to "medium"/"mediums" and "media"
* "formulas" versus "formulae"
* "terrariums" versus "terraria", "aquarium" versus "aquaria"

Fun games:

* alterninyms (eg, "Sleep, Shower, and Sundry")
* pluralization (eg, mattropodes)

Other topics:

* Style guides be damned! (Kind of.)
* descriptive versus prescriptive versus objective
* evolution versus devolution
