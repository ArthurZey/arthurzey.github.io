* In [elementary school](https://brentwoodsm-lausd-ca.schoolloop.com/){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, we had a "science lab" with Mr Cowan. My vague recollection of this lab was that it was typically more physics-oriented (as against chemistry/optics with Ms Smolen  (sp?) and another one for oceanography), but we also learned a lot about the rules of logic and had interesting logic puzzles. I remember one we had as homework, where we had to assess whether it was _illegal_ for a plane to land on the freeway. What really stood out to me was the conversation I had with my dad about it. I wanted to approach it deductively, where there either was a concrete law about it or not, and that just determined the answer--and I didn't know whether there was such a law. I was stumped. My dad tried to coach me in a certain direction: "Why would a plane land on the freeway?" I still wasn't getting it. He pointed out that _in the real world_, a plane would only land on the freeway in case of an emergency, so the whole issue of codified laws was irrelevant. I don't know that it landed with me explicitly at the time, but subconsciously, I think this had the effect of helping me to be able to resist [rationalism](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/rationalism_vs_empiricism.html){:target="&lowbar;blank"} later in life. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to derive Objectivist principles from axioms using deduction alone (a fool's errand, if there ever was one), but I think that experiences such as that one helped me to be open to a proper, inductive, _grounded_ approach to philosophy and human knowledge generally.
* As a kid, I was obsessed with reading and re-reading (_and re-reading!_) the books that were part of Time-Life's [A Child's First Library of Learning](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R8DF3C){:target="&lowbar;blank"} set. I definitely credit a large part of my curiosity about the world and desire to understand things to these books, which, while giving away some of the answers (instead of making me work for knowledge!), presented and explained a lot of things in day-to-day life and the natural sciences in a way that was cognitively accessible to a young child. My experience was one of deep satisfaction in grasping how things work. (Given the disaster that is government education, even with the best curricula at the most privileged schools, this was probably a saving grace in terms of preserving my love of learning.)
