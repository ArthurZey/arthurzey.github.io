Probably more than any other area of art, with TV, I absolutely can love or enjoy a show that I know is aesthetically bad. There are a lot of shows that I routinely call "trash" or "garbage", and I don't say that to disparage anybody involved in their production or their effort, but only that I recognize that it's bad writing, bad acting, or has some other objective defect. And yet, I may very well enjoy watching them, despite numerous flaws. I have absolutely zero shame or embarrassment around enjoying what I enjoy, and acknowledging that it's bad is not some way of rationalizing, diminishing, or making excuses for my enjoyment. I like what I like, even when it's _Gossip Girl_, and I won't apologize for it.

A good example of this principle is _Star Trek: Voyager_. I _love love love_ that show. And also, I agree with almost all criticisms of it, most of which are damning--and right. I think such criticisms are thoughtful and reflect a deep respect for _Star Trek_ and holding anything that bears that name to a high standard. But I can't stop loving the show, simultaneously loving and hating Janeway, wanting to punch Nelix in the mouth, wanting every episode to be about Seven and the Doctor, loving that, despite being on the other side of the galaxy in what amounts to a serious metaphysical emergency, they've still got their wits about them, they respect their protocols, and the ship is in perfect condition at the beginning of each episode.

And then we have _Picard_...It was fun to watch, but, uh, [yikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwF1iri1GjQ&list=PLPYTEwQJSk-BBhX6JGjpy1ZhJ6X6ZkCsq&index=18&t=0s){:target="&lowbar;blank"}. (This is dangerously close to being sacrilegious and crossing the line in terms of disrespecting _Star Trek_.)

I'm also not under any illusions that the Arrowverse shows (_Arrow_, _The Flash_, _Supergirl_, _DC's Legends of Tomorrow_, _Batwoman_) are some amazing examples of TV (I mean, they're nothing compared to Netflix's Marvel shows, especially _Jessica Jones_), but they're still fun to watch.
