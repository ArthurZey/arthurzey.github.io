* connection to [autonomy](/autonomy/) and allergy to authority
* connection to (laissez-faire) capitalism and freedom
* connection to [power](/power/)
* how it sometimes manifests in a reverse psychology way (eg, "I was going to do that, but now that you told me to do it, I don't want to anymore.")
  * connection to requests versus demands, entitlement, imposing on autonomy
* whether feelings of being out of control intensify fixations on what I _can_ control, such as diet, organizing things, investigating dermatological phenomena
* why controlling others doesn't interest me (deeply held/integrated belief that turning other people into puppets robs you of their distinctive human value to you)
* why intentionally not creating choices/incentives for people (in order to get desired outcomes) is not the same thing as control, even though it may superficially have a similar feel
* coercive control (eg, physical force or fraud) versus technically-rights-respecting manipulation
* paternalism
* connection to parenting
* control versus self-expression, per Susan Campbell's [_Getting Real: 10 Truth Skills You Need to Live an Authentic Life_](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B002L2GK5O){:target="&lowbar;blank"}: when attempting to be sensitive to what I _imagine_ is going on with someone amounts to a subconscious motive to control the situation
  * not respecting their autonomy/dignity to be responsible for their own interpretations/reactions/behavior
  * Examples:
    * I imagine that I know your Attachment Style, so I will not express myself (treat you with kid gloves) for fear of triggering you and not getting the result I want.
    * I imagine I know what else might be going on with you that you're too distraught to interpret what I tell you correctly, so I won't say anything at all.
    * Not saying _what is_ because I'm imagining that you will be upset, so I'll just tiptoe around you to avoid triggering your wrath/rage.
  * line-drawing problem and coming to a mutual understanding of standards of interaction
  * connection to Kim Scott's "ruinous empathy" concept in [_Radical Candor_](https://www.audible.com/pd/1250245788){:target="&lowbar;blank"}; maybe better termed "toxic sensitivity" here?
