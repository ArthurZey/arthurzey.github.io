* connection to [autonomy](/autonomy/) and allergy to authority
* connection to (laissez-faire) capitalism and freedom
* how it sometimes manifests in a reverse psychology way (eg, "I was going to do that, but now that you told me to do it, I don't want to anymore.")
* whether feelings of being out of control intensify fixations on what I _can_ control, such as diet, organizing things, investigating dermatological phenomena
* why controlling others doesn't interest me (deeply held/integrated belief that turning other people into puppets robs you of their distinctive human value to you)
* why intentionally not creating choices/incentives for people (in order to get desired outcomes) is not the same thing as control, even though it may superficially have a similar feel
* coercive control (eg, physical force or fraud) versus technically-rights-respecting manipulation
* paternalism
* connection to parenting
