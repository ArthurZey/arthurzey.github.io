## Narrative

### Introduction

Gosh, well, I guess I might have developed hyperthyroidism in the last few years. I wonder if it's the result of the intense stress I've been under. But the symptoms of hyperthyroidism certainly match my experience, particularly my chronic fatigue, high activation energy requirements (really, it takes a lot of whiteknuckling to get almost anything done), and general malaise and depressive anxiety. It's not that I'm that way _all_ the time, but it sure does feel like it's a lot more difficult to really _live_. I often say how much I Feel like I need to sleep for a week. I've even been relatively disinterested in weightlifting in the last few months (mostly because I've been busy with the new house), but that's really unusual for me. On the plus side, my weight has remained relatively stable.

One thing to think about here, as I consider how to address this, is the whole issue of [medical causation](/medical-causation/), since the last thing that I want to do is just treat the symptom by popping a pill, if there's something I've been doing that led to this in the first place and which I could correct through lifestyle changes.

### Maybe There's a Problem

On 2021-11-10, I got some routine bloodwork done as part of my annual physical. It revealed that my "TSH is low as hell". I haven't had any unusual weight loss recently, no tremors, no elevated heartrate, but my sex drive in the last few years had been pretty inconsistent and lower than usual, which I guessed was connected to stress and worried was connected to low testosterone (which is something I worried about before as an explanation for how difficult it is for me to put on muscle, given how hard I work and how diligent I am at the gym and with diet). My doctor ordered some thyroid-specific followup labs.

### Definite Signs of Hyperthyroidism

On 2021-11-18, I had those thyroid-specific labs done, including a few things related to testosterone and Vitamin D. (A friend pointed out [Association of High Vitamin D Status with Low Circulating Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone Independent of Thyroid Hormone Levels in Middle-Aged and Elderly Males](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Association-of-High-Vitamin-D-Status-with-Low-of-in-Zhang-Wang/b2622243904edd294e3385fe6179b11816eaef34){:target="&lowbar;blank"} and [High vitamin D status in younger individuals is associated with low circulating thyrotropin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22931506/){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, so it made sense to check, even though my Calcium levels were just fine.) Well, my T3 and T4 were pretty high, well outside the reference range. But thankfully, no sign of [Graves's disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/graves-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356240){:target="&lowbar;blank"} (which would have been suggested by high levels of Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin). My Vitamin D was also very high (reflecting my daily 10,000 IU supplementation), but that's been pretty normal for me, and it's been correlated with much better immune function for me over the years, without any (other?) sign of adverse effects. My testosterone was also happily on the high side of the normal range: "holy shit your testosterone levels haha"; "That's higher than most steroid users btw"; "ON steroids lol". That's fabulous, but it raises more questions about why putting on muscle is so difficult for me, but that's not going to be my primary focus here...

So I immediately discontinued all my [supplements](/physical-fitness/#supplements), including most notably my Vitamin D, my [Vitamin B Complex](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/basic-b-complex){:target="&lowbar;blank"} (since it includes Vitamin B<sub>7</sub> (Biotin), which [can lead to the false measurement of thyroid hormone](https://www.thyroid.org/patient-thyroid-information/ct-for-patients/december-2018/vol-11-issue-12-p-3-4/){:target="&lowbar;blank"}), and [Iodoral](https://www.optimox.com/shop/iodoral/){:target="&lowbar;blank"} (iodine/iodide, since it's not included in salt I use, and I don't eat seafood). I also stopped using any melatonin or [Z-12](https://biotest.t-nation.com/products/z-12){:target="&lowbar;blank"} as sleep aids.

I secured an appointment with an endocrinologist for 2021-12-13, and meanwhile, I set up labwork for the following Monday.

Incidentally, a medical student friend of mine did not detect any nodules.

### Discontinuation of Supplements Correlated with Lowering of T3 and T4

My 2021-11-29 labwork showed a marked lowering of T3 and T4, but still really low TSH. That leads me to wonder how much is a function of (a) discontinuing some of the supplements, (b) natural variability in hormone levels, (c) test measurement error/variability, or some combination of the those. I have a feeling the supplements are a major factor, and I wonder if with more time of not taking any supplements, the T3 and T4 levels would lower to being within the reference range, and my TSH would similarly go back to normal.

Meanwhile, I'm feeling much the same. I wonder what the appointment with the endocrinologist will yield.
