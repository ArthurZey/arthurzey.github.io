## Narrative

Gosh, well, I guess I might have developed hyperthyroidism in the last few years. I wonder if it's the result of the intense stress I've been under. But the symptoms of hyperthyroidism certainly match my experience, particularly my chronic fatigue, high activation energy requirements (really, it takes a lot of whiteknuckling to get almost anything done), and general malaise and depressive anxiety. It's not that I'm that way _all_ the time, but it sure does feel like it's a lot more difficult to really _live_. I often say how much I Feel like I need to sleep for a week. I've even been relatively disinterested in weightlifting in the last few months (mostly because I've been busy with the new house), but that's really unusual for me. On the plus side, my weight has remained relatively stable.

One thing to think about here, as I consider how to address this, is the whole issue of [medical causation](/medical-causation/), since the last thing that I want to do is just treat the symptom by popping a pill, if there's something I've been doing that led to this in the first place and which I could correct through lifestyle changes.
