* I think it relates to my desire to have clear motives for achievement/accomplishments/growth: I have to be doing it for my own internally motivated reasons, not for external validation. Praise and compliments feel good in a way, and that muddles my experience of _why_ I did/accomplished/achieved the thing. And then that feels uncomfortable.
* It's especially uncomfortable to be praised or admired for something that was not a function of my own effort, like having a handsome face. And it's even worse to be praised or admired for something that's not even true (imagine someone thought I had achieved a thing I hadn't).
* I don't think it's related to self-worth Ã  la the traditional narrative, that a person might feel discomfort with compliments because they don't feel worthy of them. I _do_ feel worthy of them, but I don't think they need to be articulated. If it's _self_-esteem, then it's _my_ job to know these things about myself, not for others to offer validation.
* I experience others' (accurate) compliments as reflecting _their_ good judgment, which allows me to judge them favorably. And it's not that I judge them favorably because they judged me favorably (ie, just because that feels nice), but because it reflects their having good, objective judgment. I joke that when someone compliments me, they're bragging about their good judgment.
* This all seems incredibly narcissistic/vain (not in the sense of [narcissistic personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder){:target="&lowbar;blank"}), but in a more first-handed than second-handed way. It's the opposite of what people expect of narcissism (using the term sloppily, as it often is in our culture), since my disposition is in the opposite direction of "narcissists'" typical attention-seeking.
* the symmetry of naturally not offering praise or compliments, either
  * On my end, it often feels performative and as though it comes across as inauthentic, even if I do sincerely mean the compliment.
* related to _Words of Affirmation_ being my least strong Love Language
* praising effort versus results, aligned with having a [growth mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset#Fixed_and_growth_mindset){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
