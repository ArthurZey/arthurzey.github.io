We hear the word "depression", and we readily conclude we're talking about a mental illness or disease. While it _may_, in some cases, manifest as a pathology, I think that many times, it is just a natural part of human life and experience.

Additional considerations:

* What factors contribute to resilience to depressive states? Feelings of worthiness and lovability? Self-esteem?
* Why do we have to give explanations for crying, but not for laughing?
* Why are we ritualistically expected to answer "Okay" or "Fine" to inquiries about how we're doing? Isn't it okay (in a broader sense) to be _not_ okay at a given moment? And what does the receptivity of the questioner have to do with it?
* The unhelpfulness of "Everything will be okay."; maybe it won't, and isn't _that_ okay in its own way?
* depression versus "chemical imbalance"
* On 2020-08-01, Helen sent me a link to [A third of Americans now show signs of clinical anxiety or depression](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/05/26/americans-with-depression-anxiety-pandemic/); it provoked the following response from me:
  * Here's the thing about "depression": Pathologizing the normal human experience of feeling sad (even for extended periods of time) is what saps people of the resilience to deal with sadness. Because then it's not "normal", so they feel helplessly in the power of a "condition" they cannot control...except through pharmacological intervention. An intervention that actually also undermines the ability to experience joy (fuckin' SSRIs), which then further compromises any possible resilience to sadness. And on and on, it's a vicious cycle. Same shit--often hand-in-hand--with anxiety.
