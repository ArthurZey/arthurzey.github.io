We hear the word "depression", and we readily conclude we're talking about a mental illness or disease. While it _may_, in some cases, manifest as a pathology, I think that many times, it is just a natural part of human life and experience.

Additional considerations:

* What factors contribute to resilience to depressive states? Feelings of worthiness and lovability? Self-esteem?
* Why do we have to give explanations for crying, but not for laughing?
* Why are we ritualistically expected to answer "Okay" or "Fine" to inquiries about how we're doing? Isn't it okay (in a broader sense) to be _not_ okay at a given moment? And what does the receptivity of the questioner have to do with it?
* The unhelpfulness of "Everything will be okay."; maybe it won't, and isn't _that_ okay in its own way?
* depression versus "chemical imbalance"
