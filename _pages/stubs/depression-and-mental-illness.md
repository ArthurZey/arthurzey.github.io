We hear the word "depression", and we readily conclude we're talking about a mental illness or disease. While it _may_, in some cases, manifest as a pathology, I think that many times, it is just a natural part of human life and experience.

Additional considerations:

* What factors contribute to resilience to depressive states? Feelings of worthiness and lovability? Self-esteem?
