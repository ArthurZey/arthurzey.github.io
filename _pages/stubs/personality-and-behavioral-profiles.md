  * mind: 72% introverted\\
  _Introverted individuals prefer solitary activities and get exhausted by social interaction. They tend to be quite sensitive to external stimulation (eg, sound, sight, or smell) in general._
  * energy: 58% intuitive\\
  _Intuitive individuals are very imaginative, open-minded, and curious. They prefer novelty over stability and focus on hidden meanings and future possibilities._
  * nature: 61% feeling\\
  _Feeling individuals are sensitive and emotionally expressive. They are more empathic and less competitive than Thinking types, and focus on social harmony and cooperation._
  * tactics: 60% judging\\
  _Judging individuals are decisive, thorough, and highly organized. They value clarity, predictability, and closure, preferring structure and planning to spontaneity._
  * identity: 56% turbulent\\
  _Turbulent individuals are self-conscious and sensitive to stress. They are likely to experience a wide range of emotions and to be success-driven, perfectionistic, and eager to improve._

I'm not sure that Myers-Briggs is especially helpful, but I think it's interesting. I think that the tests are really badly designed (lots of false dichotomies and poor wording that will militate a type in the wrong direction if answered accurately). In 2015, I decided to do my own analysis, reading through the 16 descriptions and bucketing them into (1) identify with strongly, (2) identify with weakly, and (3) don't identify with at all. The results were unsurprisingly consistent:
* All the **\*N\*J** types were in the _identify with strongly_ bucket.
* All the **\*N\*P** types were in the _identify with weakly_ bucket.
* All the <b>\*S\*\*</b> types were in the _don't identify with at all_ bucket.

The interpretation of this, given the premises of Myers-Briggs, is as follows:
* Abstract thinking is my strongest trait, and I'm not concrete-bound.
* I'm mostly type-A, but I can go with the flow if necessary.
* I'm equally split on **E**/**I** and **T**/**F**.

One of the many problems here is that **N** is often characterized as big-picture, abstract thinking (without implying a difficulty in dealing with particulars), whereas **S** is often characterized as being concrete-bound and _unable_ to deal with abstractions. So that makes my results all the less surprising.

With respect to being type-A (**J**) versus going with the flow (**P**), the way I think about that is that I like things how I like them, I like to plan, I like structure and order, and I am selectively flexible, in circumscribed contexts. It's a bit of an exaggeration, but think of it as needing to plan unstructured time on the calendar. A realistic example might be something like _**J**: Today, we're going to go snowboarding. **P**: It doesn't matter to me which resort we go to or what time we arrive or leave. **J**: It would sure be nice to know in advance what the plan is. **P**: But it's no big deal if we wing it._

I tend to test high on **E**, but that's not necessarily surprising, since I get energy from discussing ideas (and that involves people), even though I actually consider myself an introvert, since people are exhausting. So reading the descriptions, I'm en even split, but [I don't think that's really right](/introversion-and-extroversion/).

There's a lot more to be said about **T** "versus" **F**, but I'll summarize here. The clearest articulation I've read of the essence of the dichotomy is that it's about what your initial reaction is to a situation or stimulus: Do you first have the big emotion and defer analysis until you've calmed down (**F**)? Or do you first get into analysis, waiting to process feelings later (**T**)? Now, this framing might mostly apply to most people, so I can see why it might be useful. But it's difficult for me to relate to it. It's why I characterize myself as a logic-emotions monist. I have all the feelings and all the thoughts all the time, always. Something happens, and I'm immediately analyzing it _and_ having/embracing/processing strong emotions. While it's possible to separate out thinking and feeling for analysis, experientially, it's all the same phenomenon for me. (I think that's also related to the connection between emotions and induction.) Thinking and feeling are just different dimensions of the same experience. Of course, because of the way that most Myers-Briggs test questions are framed, I end up scoring as a very high **F**, but in reality (and I think the type descriptions bear this out), I'm just very high on both. Technically, I think it's a false dichotomy.

By the way, what do you think it says about my likely Myers-Briggs type that I went through all that analysis?

[Questioner](https://quiz.gretchenrubin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/questioner-Report.pdf){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
* Questioners question all expectations, and they respond to an expectation only if they conclude that it makes sense--in essence, they meet only inner expectations. They're motivated by reason, logic, and fairness. They wake up and think "What _needs_ to get done today, and why?".
* Resists outer expectations.
* Meets inner expectations.
* "I do what I think is best, according to my judgment. If it doesn't make sense, I won't do it."
* Arguments such as "Everyone has to do this.", "You said you'd do this.", "Because I say so.", or "I'm the doctor." aren't compelling to a Questioner.\\
_Well, "You said you'd do this." does indeed resonate with me, since my commitments have become inner expectations (living up to integrity and responsibility)._

  * OCEAN
    * **Openness**: 90%\\
    _Openness describes a person's tendency to think in abstract, complex ways. High scorers tend to be creative, adventurous, and intellectual. They enjoy playing with ideas and discovering novel experiences. Low scorers tend to be practical, conventional, and focused on the concrete. They tend to avoid the unknown and follow traditional ways._\\
    _Openness is strongly related to a person's interest in art and culture. People who are high in openness tend to enjoy the arts and seek out unusual, complex forms of self-expression. People who are low in openness are often suspicious of the arts and prefer to focus on more practical pursuits._
    * **Conscientiousness**: 79%\\
    _Conscientiousness describes a person's ability to exercise self-discipline and control in order to pursue their goals. High scorers are organized and determined, and are able to forego immediate gratification for the sake of long-term achievement. Low scorers are impulsive and easily sidetracked._\\
    _The concept of Conscientiousness focuses on a dilemma we all face: shall I do what feels good now, or instead do what is less fun but will pay off in the future? Some people are more likely to choose fun in the moment, and thus are low in Conscientiousness. Others are more likely to work doggedly toward their goals, and thus are high in this trait._
    * **Extraversion**: 79% ([_hah!_](/introversion-and-extroversion/))\\
    _Extraversion describes a person's inclination to seek stimulation from the outside world, especially in the form of attention from other people. Extraverts engage actively with others to earn friendship, admiration, power, status, excitement, and romance. Introverts, on the other hand, conserve their energy, and do not work as hard to earn these social rewards._\\
    _Extraversion seems to be related to the emotional payoff that a person gets from achieving a goal. While everyone experiences victories in life, it seems that extroverts are especially thrilled by these victories, especially when they earn the attention of others. Getting a promotion, finding a new romance, or winning an award are all likely to bring an extrovert great joy. In contrast, introverts do not experience as much of a "high" from social achievements. They tend to be more content with simple, quiet lives, and rarely seek attention from others._
    * **Agreeableness**: 71%\\
    _Agreeableness describes a person's tendency to put others' needs ahead of their own, and to cooperate rather than compete with others. People who are high in Agreeableness experience a great deal of empathy and tend to get pleasure out of serving and taking care of others. They are usually trusting and forgiving._\\
    _People who are low in Agreeableness tend to experience less empathy and put their own concerns ahead of others. Low scorers are often described as hostile, competitive, and antagonistic. They tend to have more conflictual relationships and often fall out with people._
    * **Neuroticism**: 50%\\
    _Neuroticism describes a person's tendency to experience negative emotions, including fear, sadness, anxiety, guilt, and shame. While everyone experiences these emotions from time to time, some people are more prone to them than others._\\
    _This trait can be thought of as an alarm system. People experience negative emotions as a sign that something is wrong in the world. You may be in danger, so you feel fear. Or you may have done something morally wrong, so you feel guilty. However, not everyone has the same reaction to a given situation. High Neuroticism scorers are more likely to react to a situation with fear, anger, sadness, and the like. Low Neuroticism scorers are more likely to brush off their misfortune and move on._
  * Core Personality Patterns\\
  _This circumplex describes the essential role you take on in approaching the world. This role is a reflection of your core values and motivations, as well as the way you think about things._
    * **Empathic Idealist**: 80%\\
    _Uses insight and creativity to help others. Thinks about how the world could be a better and more beautiful place._
    * **Analytical Thinker**: 59%\\
    _Solves logical problems with rational, complex analysis. Thinks about innovative ways to improve systems._
    * **Practical Caretaker**: 41%\\
    _Helps other people in practical, everyday ways. Uses established institutions to maintain stability and security._
    * **Logical Mechanic**: 20%\\
    _Ensures accuracy and efficiency in logical systems. Uses proven methods to accomplish real-world goals._

## D&D Alignment
**[Chaotic Good](http://easydamus.com/chaoticgood.html){:target="&lowbar;blank"}**

A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him. He makes his own way, but he's kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society.

Chaotic good is the best alignment you can be because it combines a good heart with a free spirit.

Chaotic good can be a dangerous alignment when it disrupts the order of society and punishes those who do well for themselves.

While creatures of this alignment view freedom and the randomness of actions as ultimate truths, they likewise place value on life and the welfare of each individual. Respect for individualism is also great. By promoting the philosophy of chaotic good, characters of this alignments seek to spread their values throughout the world. To the chaotic good individual, freedom and independence are as important to life and happiness. The ethos views this freedom as the only means by which each creature can achieve true satisfaction and happiness. Law, order, social forms, and anything else which tends to restrict or abridge individual freedom is wrong, and each individual is capable of achieving self-realization and prosperity through himself, herself, or itself.

Chaotic good characters are strong individualists marked by a streak of kindness and benevolence. They believe in all the virtues of goodness and right, but they have little use for laws and regulations. They have no use for people who "try to push folk around and tell them what to do." Their actions are guided by their own moral compass which, although good, may not always be in perfect agreement with the rest of society.

These characters are basically good, but tend to be selfish and maybe a bit greedy. They tend to hold personal freedom and welfare above anything else. The chaotic good dislikes confining laws, self-discipline, and they distrust authority.

Chaotic goods believe that freedom is the only means by which each creature can achieve true satisfaction and happiness. Law, order, social forms, and anything else which tends to restrict individual freedom is wrong, and each individual is capable of achieving self-realization and prosperity through himself. These characters believe that life has no grand plan, but each creature's spirit is essentially noble and good. Each being must follow his own conscience. By performing good acts the individual can hope to alleviate the suffering and anguish of others, whether caused by random or structured acts.

The chaotic good character has a "beatific" attitude toward existence. In this character's opinion, any laws, social structures, or other such hierarchies that restrict his freedom are abhorrent and to be done away with. The inviolable right of the individual to seek his own pleasures is one of the cornerstones of society; but, being good, the chaotic good being will not tread on others to get his own way, for he feels that every other creature has the right to the pursuit of pleasure as well. Friends of a chaotic good character will find him unreliable in the clutch only if he puts his own well-being ahead of that of his companions. Obviously, almost everyone has this tendency, but it is left up to this individual whether or not he values a friendship enough to risk self sacrifice. The chaotic good being would not, however, take action that could unnecessarily jeopardize the lives of other persons or creatures. Life is valuable, but without sufficient personal freedom it is demeaned. Life and freedom are the foundation of the universe.

A chaotic good character will keep his word to those who are not evil and will lie only to evil-doers. He will never attack an unarmed foe and will never harm an innocent. He will not use torture to extract information or for pleasure, but he may "rough up" someone to get information. He will never kill for pleasure, only in self-defense or in the defense of others. A chaotic good character will never use poison. He will help those in need and he prefers to work alone, as he values his freedom. He does not respond well to higher authority, is distrustful of organizations, and will disregard the law in his fight against evil. He will never betray a family member, comrade, or friend. Chaotic good characters do not respect the concepts of self-discipline and honor, because they believe such concepts limit freedom to act.

Here are some possible adjectives describing chaotic good characters: unpredictable, independent, free spirited, cheerful, optimistic, easy going, carefree, helpful, kind, merciful, respectful of personal liberties, and anarchic.

Well known chaotic good characters from film or literature include: Han Solo (Star Wars), Batman (DC Comics), Fred and George Weasley (Harry Potter), and Robin Hood.

Equivalent alignment in other game systems: Unprincipled (Palladium), Light Side (Star Wars), Good (Warhammer), Gallant (Alternity).

A chaotic good government influences the community by helping the needy and opposing restrictions on freedom. In a chaotic good society, The people mean well and try to do right, but are hampered by a natural dislike of big government. Although there may be a single ruler, most communities are allowed to manage themselves, so long as their taxes are paid and they obey a few broad edicts. Such areas tend to have weak law enforcement organizations. A local sheriff, baron, or council may hire adventurers to fill the gap. Communities often take the law into their own hands when it seems necessary. Lands on the fringes of vast empires far from the capital tend to have this type of alignment.
