There are a lot of phrases we use that have subtle psychological effects on how we approach ourselves, others, and the world generally.

I've been thinking a lot about certain kinds of reframings that have been very helpful for me:

* "[X] makes me feel [Y]" &rarr; "I feel [Y] because [X] holds [Z] meaning for me" or "hearing [X], I feel [Y]"
* "endure" &rarr; "choose"
* "let go" &rarr; "sit with" or "let be"
* "let myself [X]" &rarr; "direct myself [X]" or just "I [X]"
* "get past" &rarr; "work through"
* "fix" &rarr; "heal"
* "broken" &rarr; "wounded"
* "change" &rarr; "grow"
* "you [X]" &rarr; "I'm imagining you [X]" or "the story I'm telling myself is you [X]"
* "balance" &rarr; "integrate"
* "negative emotions" &rarr; "unpleasant emotions"
* "angry at" &rarr; "angry that"
