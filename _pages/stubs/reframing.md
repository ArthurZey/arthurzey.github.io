There are a lot of phrases we use that have subtle psychological effects on how we approach ourselves, others, and the world generally.

I've been thinking a lot about certain kinds of reframings that have been very helpful for me:

1. "[X] makes me feel [Y]" &rarr; "I feel [Y] because [X] holds [Z] meaning for me"
2. "endure" &rarr; "choose"
3. "let go" &rarr; "sit with" or "let be"
4. "let myself [X]" &rarr; "direct myself [X]" or just "I [X]"
5. "get past" &rarr; "work through"
6. "fix" &rarr; "heal"
7. "change" &rarr; "grow"
8. "you [X] &rarr; "I'm imagining you [X]" or "the story I'm telling myself is you [X]"
