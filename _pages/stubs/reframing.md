description: "There are a lot of terms we use that have subtle psychological effects in how we approach ourselves, others, and the world generally. I've been thinking a lot about certain kinds of reframings that have been very helpful for me:<br />(1) \"[X] makes me feel\" &rarr; \"I feel [Y] because...\"<br />(2) \"endure\" &rarr; \"choose\"<br />(3) \"let go\" &rarr; \"sit with\"<br />(4) \"let myself\" &rarr; \"direct myself\"<br />(5) \"get past\" &rarr; \"work through\"<br />(6) \"fix\" &rarr; \"heal\", (7) \"change\" &rarr; \"grow\""
