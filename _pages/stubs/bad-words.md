description: "Whether \"curse words\" or hurtful words, whether rooted in sexism, racism, sex-negativity, or anything else, there's a lot to say about how we use language and so-called \"bad words\"."

There are a lot of dimensions here I'd like to explore...and I might have to split some of this off into different posts altogether:

* "curse words" (eg, "fuck") versus hurtful words (eg, "retarded")
* relevance of a word's etymology and usage; eg,
  * "pussy" to mean weak
  * "retarded" to mean slow
  * "ballsy" to mean courageous
  * "man up" to mean "get it together"
  * "hysteria" originating in being a neurotic condition peculiar to women and thought to be caused by a dysfunction of the uterus, now used to mean exaggerated or uncontrollable emotion or excitement (also "hysterical" to mean funny)
* cultural power differentials and using words with disparaging intent (eg, "pussy" versus "dick")
* whether members of a group are (more) entitled to uses a particular term (eg, Black people using "nigger", gay people using "fag")
* "Black" versus "African-American", "Oriental" versus "Chinese", etc
* the _LGBT.*_ acronym
* "the n-word" and related hypocrisy (no, not "nigger"; literally the phrase "the n-word")
  * see also [Louis CK Hates The N Word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRkUIKozxKI){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
* non-collectivist issues, such as the insidious influence of sex-negativity (eg, referring to one's genitalia as "my junk", using words like "pussy", "cunt", or "dick" as disparaging terms at all)
* non-binary gender considerations for pronouns
* using "technically" gendered terms for gender-agnostic purposes (eg, "Man", "he", "dude", "guys")
* the relevance of intent
  * saying unkind things in a nice way
  * using technically "wholesome" words to convey unkindness
  * the speaker's meaning attached to words
  * the speaker's concern for the listener's sensitivities (rational and irrational)
    * analogy to someone's fear of dog (also recent bite versus long-standing fear) at a party versus allergy to dogs
    * scenario of someone recently having been the victim of bigotry and therefore very sensitive
* the listener's responsibility
  * in self-regulation and reaction
  * in judging the speaker
  * in asking for what they want politely, rather than with an attitude of entitlement or condescension
* corporate policies on terminology to use versus private / interpersonal contexts
  * when to speak up
    * motives
    * ineffective techniques
* the perils of "word police", particularly that when it seems that certain prohibitions/fixations are uncalibrated to a rational level of sensitivity and tact, thereby resulting in rejection of _any_ sensitivity of word use by exactly the people who most need to adjust their approach (throwing the baby out with the bathwater)
* cultural appropriation
  * interest versus respect versus derision
  * whether that even makes sense as a concept for a global / multicultural company
* "Lighten up; it's just a joke."
  * untangling whether the joke is reinforcing racism/sexism/etc or actually making fun of how ridiculous it is
* connections to parenting and use of words around/with children
* perhaps subject for a different post, but connection to stereotypes generally and the role of "positive" stereotypes
* my own journey
  * allergy to "retarded" in particular
