description: "Whether \"curse words\" or hurtful words, whether rooted in sexism, racism, sex-negativity, or anything else, there's a lot to say about how we use language and so-called \"bad words\"."

There are a lot of dimensions here I'd like to explore...and I might have to split some of this off into different posts altogether:

* "curse words" (eg, "fuck") versus hurtful words (eg, "retarded")
* relevance of a word's etymology and usage (eg, "pussy" to mean weak, "retarded" to mean slow, "ballsy" to mean courageous, "man up" to mean "get it together")
* cultural power differentials and using words with disparaging intent (eg, "pussy" versus "dick")
* whether members of a group are (more) entitled to uses a particular term (eg, Black people using "nigger", gay people using "fag")
* "Black" versus "African-American", "Oriental" versus "Chinese", etc
* the _LGBT.*_ acronym
* "the n-word" and related hypocrisy (no, not "nigger"; literally the phrase "the n-word")
  * see also [Louis CK Hates The N Word](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRkUIKozxKI){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
* non-collectivist issues, such as the insidious influence of sex-negativity (eg, referring to one's genitalia as "my junk", using words like "pussy", "cunt", or "dick" as disparaging terms at all)
* non-binary gender considerations for pronouns
* using "technically" gendered terms for gender-agnostic purposes (eg, "Man", "he", "dude", "guys")
* the relevance of intent
  * saying unkind things in a nice way
  * using technically "wholesome" words to convey unkindness
  * the speaker's meaning attached to words
  * the speaker's concern for the listener's sensitivities (rational and irrational)
* the listener's responsibility
  * in self-regulation and reaction
  * in judging the speaker
  * in asking for what they want politely, rather than an attitude of entitlement or condescension
* corporate policies on terminology to use versus private / interpersonal contexts
  * when to speak up
    * motives
    * ineffective techniques
* cultural appropriation
  * interest versus respect versus derision
  * whether that even makes sense as a concept for a global / multicultural company
* "Lighten up; it's just a joke."
  * untangling whether the joke is reinforcing racism/sexism/etc or actually making fun of how ridiculous it is
* connections to parenting and use of words around/with children
* perhaps subject for a different post, but connection to stereotypes generally and the role of "positive" stereotypes
* my own journey
  * allergy to "retarded" in particular
