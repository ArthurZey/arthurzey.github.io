What are these three stages? How do they manifest? How does one progress from one to the next?

Many social movements call for "tolerance", but if an individual feels merely "tolerated", that itself can feel intolerable.

What about "acceptance"? A great deal of literature describes the deep human need to feel accepted; but is there a meaningful difference between being "accepted" and being "supported"? If so, what is it, and what is its value?
