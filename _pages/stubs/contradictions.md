Alleged contradictions, which, when understood in essential terms, aren't contradictions at all:

* acceptance and judging
* content and wanting more
* caring about others for their own sakes and being self-interested
* exerting effort (eg, in meditation) and letting things be

Needless to say, perhaps, there's a strong connection to the ways in which I'm [misunderstood](/misunderstood/).
