An important feature of these is that I _should have_ and _could have_ known better, but it was my own failing that led to the bad result. Sure, there are plenty of things where I made (innocent) mistakes and regret how things turned out, but I don't feel the same level of culpability and self-condemnation for those sorts of things.

* throwing Kisses across the room
* "competitive analysis" for CDNetworks
* snapping at Tom in 2015
* law school

Additional angles to consider:

* doing the best that I could / role of limbic system hijack
* what I mean by the concept of "shame" here; how that differs from worthiness and Bren√© Brown's usage
