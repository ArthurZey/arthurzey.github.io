Objectivism already differentiates between the generic sense of "value", which might best be best characterized as "that which one acts to gain and or keep". This strikes me as a more descriptive sense of the term. The philosophy differentiates it from a more metaphysical sense of the term, which is about what, _in fact_ supports one's interests: it's a value if it actually leads to happiness and prosperity. Sometimes, that's called an "objective value" to emphasize that. I realized recently that there's another sense of the term, which is one's _professed_ values, which may differ from both.

There's a strong parallel here to "needs" an "wants", too.
