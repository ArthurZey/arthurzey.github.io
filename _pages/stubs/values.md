Objectivism already differentiates between the generic sense of "value", which might best be best characterized as "that which one acts to gain and or keep" and what one might call more metaphysical, in the sense of what, _in fact_ supports one's interests: it's a value if it actually leads to happiness and prosperity. Sometimes, that's called an "objective value" to emphasize that. I realized recently that there's another sense of the term, which is one's _professed_ values, which may differ from both.

There's a strong parallel here to "needs" versus "wants", too.
