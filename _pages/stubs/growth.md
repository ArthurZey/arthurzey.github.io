description: "I really like myself, but my good-/right-by-default attitude has the built-in failure mode of making it difficult to identify areas for growth. Nevertheless, I've found a few things I can work on."

* psychological dispositions
  * caring too much (qualitatively and quantitatively) what others think, both about me and about _the truth_ in general
  * defensiveness about being misunderstood
  * uncritically defaulting to connecting with other people in intellectual/academic ways, trying to talk talk talk through everything
  * learning how to navigate the line between
    * leaning into discomfort and pain, wrestling with and processing difficult emotions (without this being an intentional pursuit of misery)
    * redirecting attention to more pleasant experiences / "distracting" myself (without this being numbing / evasion / repression)
  * learning how to _not_ allow my now-automatic compassion and empathy
    * to overwhelm me emotionally
    * to function as enablement, when it's in response to others' inappropriate behavior (ie, figure out how to hold people accountable while knowing that they're doing their best and are trying to pursue legitimate values)
  * procrastination
  * risk-aversion, the devil I know, inertia; my orientation toward routines and comfort undermining taking action to make bigger, non-incremental changes
  * not wanting to "use things up", then losing them anyway
  * letting the "perfect" be the enemy of the good
* specific behaviors
  * investigating dermatological phenomena
  * nail-biting
