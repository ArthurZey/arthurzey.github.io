description: "I really like myself, but my good-/right-by-default attitude has the built-in failure mode of making it difficult to identify areas for growth. Nevertheless, I've found a few things I can work on."

* psychological dispositions
  * caring too much (qualitatively and quantitatively) what others think, both about me and about _the truth_ in general
  * defensiveness about being misunderstood
  * uncritically defaulting to connecting with other people in intellectual/academic ways, trying to talk talk talk through everything
  * learning how to navigate the line between
    * leaning into discomfort and pain, wrestling with and processing difficult emotions (without this being an intentional pursuit of misery)
    * redirecting attention to more pleasant experiences / "distracting" myself (without this being numbing / evasion / repression)
  * learning how to _not_ allow my now-automatic compassion and empathy
    * to overwhelm me emotionally
    * to function as enablement, when it's in response to others' inappropriate behavior (ie, figure out how to hold people accountable while knowing that they're doing their best and are trying to pursue legitimate values)
  * procrastination
  * risk-aversion, the devil I know, inertia; my orientation toward routines and comfort undermining taking action to make bigger, non-incremental changes
  * learning to how to better navigate the line between
    * deescalation, being tactful, avoiding/preventing conflict ("conflict-aversion")
    * standing up for _the truth_, being authentic, not being a doormat
  * learning how to be sensitive, compassionate, caring, understanding, tactful _without_ its landing as overthinking, game-playing, manipulation, sociopathic
  * learning how to determine when, if ever, "tough love" is appropriate instead of softer compassion
    * whether it's justified to artificially use a sharper, tactless tone because it will land better / be more effective in the moment with a person whose wounds might cause compassion to land badly (and what the long-term consequences of doing this might be)
    * connection to how Libertarians will often use any argument, no matter how inessential or false, that is convincing to a particular group/person in the moment, sometimes pandering to things like religion and altruism
    * what the cost is to authenticity to intentionally do an unkind thing when I do not want to be unkind (whether it's being disingenuous to myself and my values and _who I am_ to be tactless because it's pandering to another person's unhealthy dispositions)
  * susceptibility to the sunken-cost fallacy
  * how the anxiety of one-way door decisions (or cost of reversing certain decisions) leads me to indecision and inaction
    * eg, plane travel
    * not wanting to "use things up", then losing them anyway (eg, stickers, food items)
  * letting the "perfect" be the enemy of the good
* specific behaviors
  * investigating dermatological phenomena
  * nail-biting
* general skills
  * [mind-body-emotion connection](/mind-body-emotion-connection/): better awareness of my physical body experience, especially in the grips of powerful emotions, but also in using physical body experience as a way of influencing emotional experience
