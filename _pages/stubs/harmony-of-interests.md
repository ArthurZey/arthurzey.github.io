description: "There is no such thing as a win-lose interaction; \"only care about yourself\" is a logically incoherent idea."

There is a lot to say on this topic, and it connects with many other areas. Here are a few things I'd like to examine:

* the scope of "interests" and "selfishness": not just material wealth, but everything we think of broadly to encompass a happy, joyful, prosperous life, and how that can mean different things for different people (without rendering the whole matter merely subjective whim/declaration)
* short-term versus long-term considerations of interests
* the harmony of _genuine_ human interests
* _genuine_ human interests versus contradictory / mutually exclusive desires
* how all interactions are ultimately either win-win or lose-lose, that anything purported to be win-lose is really lose-lose
  * address examples like sports and games, with artificially created win-lose constraints
* "only care about yourself" / using "selfish" to mean cynically exploitative of others
  * the interdependence of interests and how _actually_ caring about yourself inherently requires caring about others; therefore, the contradiction inherent in the idea of being able to care about oneself without caring about others
  * the equivocation of explicit focus (operative motive) and factual, long-term considerations (eg, parties negotiating to get the best outcome possible for themselves in a business dealing)
  * how linguistic sloppiness (eg, "Oh, come on, you knew that what I meant was that he was pursuing short-term gain / whims at the expense of others and his true long-term interests!") encourages cultural misunderstanding of egoism
* the difference between knowing, in "cold economic calculus" terms, that others and their interests are a means to one's own interests and experiencing, emotionally, others as ends in themselves
* how caring about others and their interests is incompatible with altruism (in its serious ethical sense, not its sloppy colloquial sense)
* connection to psychology, emotional well-being, worthiness, shame-resilience: ["To say 'I love you' one must first know how to say the 'I.''"](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/513234-to-say-i-love-you-one-must-first-know-how){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
* connection to assuming positive intent and believing that people are generally doing the best that they can
* how interdependence of interests does not contradict the [virtue of independence](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/independence.html){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
* examples from business and product management
  * Twitter's "respect the user's voice"
  * integration of interests of company, employees, users, customers, developers
