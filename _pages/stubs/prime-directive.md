For at least a few decades after really getting into Star Trek in high school, I'd been rather skeptical (and perhaps even derisive) of the [Federation's "highest law"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Directive). I won't go into a full description of it, let alone a full analysis, since that's not really my point here. But in short, if you can't be bothered to click through, it's a prohibition of Starfleet officers from interfering in the natural development of pre-warp (ie, less advanced) species.

I had a few problems with this, including
* how it smacks of moral and cultural relativism
* how absurd it is that it's been elevated to General Order 1
* how it requires tolerating tremendous suffering

But as a _guideline_ or cautionary principle, I think it's very worthwhile to consider. Even the best intentions can have unforeseen adverse consequences, and the Prime Directive is trying to avoid such ill effects. (The most stark example of what might be avoided is giving a relatively primitive culture advanced technology in the spirit of trying to help them that they then turn around and annihilate themselves with.)

Epistemologically, one thing that I like about the Prime Directive is that it parallels the idea of respecting others' context of knowledge in communicating with them. Skilled communicators will often take great care to consider their audiences' contexts of knowledge, using language and concepts that will make sense to them; they meet them where they are. An application of this idea that's very near and dear to my heart is pedagogy: A teacher's role is not to dole out answers to be memorized, but to foster the natural curiosity of children to find genuine understanding, which is accomplished (in part) by tailoring lessons to that context.

And the Prime Directive reminds me of this principle. A more technologically and philosophically advanced culture needs to take great care to engage with a less advanced culture in a way that respects their ability to learn and grow and develop in a healthy way. (Sometimes, the struggle and the perseverance are so much more important than some concrete end, but I definitely want to distinguish struggle from unnecessary suffering.)

[TO DO] Other points:
* how I feel nowadays
* my history with activism; being mindful of a false dichotomy
* what I'd do with omnipotent powers
* connection to a benevolent god, the Ancients
* people have to take their own journeys, and it's not even my job to show them a map
