* no cycling; need to be careful with squats, leg press, snowboarding, walking down stairs (!), getting in and out of cars (!); no problem running
* can do static holds of any weight my quads can support at any knee angle; problem is _moving_ weight through certain angles
* probably result of muscling my way up hills while cycling during triathlons in college
* numerous MRIs and ultrasounds reveal nothing; my allegedly "beautiful" ACLs and menisci
* "patellofemoral syndrome"
* things that maybe helped
  * glucosamine (HT [Emily Webb](https://www.freedombodytraining.com/){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, one of my favorite (now-former) Krav Maga instructors)
  * corkscrewing feet
  * [massage](https://voxsynaesthetica.wordpress.com/massage-therapist/){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
  * [Vibrams](https://us.vibram.com/shop/fivefingers/men/){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
  * TBD: physical therapy with [Quinn Henoch of Clinical Athlete](https://www.clinicalathlete.com/users/quinn-henoch-4584360f-e4fa-4ff7-8960-d95215b1ddff/profile){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
