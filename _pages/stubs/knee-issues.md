* no cycling; need to be careful with squats, leg press, snowboarding, walking down stairs (!); no problem running
* can do static holds of any weight my quads can support at any knee angle; problem is _moving_ weight through certain angles
* probably result of muscling my way up hills while cycling during triathlons in college
* numerous MRIs and ultrasounds reveal nothing; my "beautiful" ACLs and menisci
* "patellofemoral syndrome"
* things that maybe helped: glucosamine, corkscrewing feet, massage, Vibrams
