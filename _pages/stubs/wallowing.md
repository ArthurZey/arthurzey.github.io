Sometimes, sadness happens. It just grips us in the moment. And, depending on the context, we need to decide whether to lean into it or redirect our focus.

Leaning into it can manifest in healthier and unhealthier ways: It might be a mechanism for processing one's feelings. Or it can be debilitating and cause one to slip in to a more persistent depressive state. I don't think there's a blanket answer, but my own experience suggests that, other things equal, when an emotion pipes up, it's a good idea to listen to it and give it the space it needs. That doesn't mean to thoughtlessly emote all over everybody around you, but it _does_ mean sitting with it, finding a safe/constructive way to express it (laughing, crying, yelling, retching, writing, _talking_). We do have to regulate our behavior in contextually appropriate ways, but that doesn't undermine the need and value and ability of feeling all the feels.

Similarly, redirecting focus can manifest in healthier and unhealthier ways: It might be a way of guiding our [emotional recalibration](/emotional-control/) or simply needing to defer emotional processing because of more immediate demands and values. Or if it's a pattern, it can be a dangerous form of repression that later [spills out as anger](/anger-management/).

So imagine there's a particular stressor, especially if chronic, such as challenges at work, the death of a family member, difficulties in a romantic relationship, or a falling out with a close friend.

A number of things might unintentionally trigger feelings:

* an acute "incident"
* a photo that comes up on a smart display's rotation
* a song that comes on in a playlist shuffle
* a scene in a TV show
* an offhand comment by a friend

But once one is starting to have the emotional reaction, one might engage in activities that intensify the emotion:

* listen to _more_ triggering music
* looking through _more_ photos
* ruminating / spinning out
* crying
* talking to a friend
* writing in a journal

The question is whether these behaviors of intensifying the emotions are useful and healthy or whether they are harmful:

* Do these behaviors aid in processing emotions, or do they amount to pursuing a course of more misery?
* What factors are relevant in figuring out the best course in any given context?
* What is the connection between short-term effects and long-term effects?
* Does the _willingness_ to feel great despair (and fully leaning into it when it happens) have the seemingly paradoxical effect of lessening the frequency or intensity of despair? (Perhaps this is indirect, since it has to do with processing things before they escalate to the level of despair?)
* Is it a good idea to retain emotional triggers (eg, keep that photo from a funeral in a rotation, keep the association of a particular song with a former lover)?
* Is the willingness to lean into (even frequent) "depressive episodes" the same as "being depressed"? Depression and sadness are unpleasant, sure--we generally want less--but why do we have this [pathologizing stigma associated with depression](/depression-and-mental-illness/)?
* What factors contribute to resilience to depressive states? Feelings of worthiness and lovability? Self-esteem?

My personal disposition is to "wallow", and not just about sad things, but whatever the equivalent would be for anxiety and anger _and joy_. It's just a consistent policy of embracing strong, deep feelings about _all the things_. What works for me is having my emotional volume turned up to 11. (And I have to be careful about vomiting that intensity all over other people, whether of the unpleasant _or_ joyous variety.) I _love_ having myself a good cry when I'm sad. Getting in the mood for that and intensifying that mood by listening to sad music allows me to process that sadness. Because I don't experience emotions and (logical/cognitive) analysis as separate phenomena, this also comes up for me as ruminating or "spinning out" about past, present, and future. I can't articulate how that processing works in either psychological or physiological terms. But I can tell you that I feel more "complete" when I've done that, rather than just distracting myself with something fun. It's a way of being present with _what is_ instead of trying to reject it through what, for me, would amount to repression. (Sure, I can defer a cry for a later time if the feelings come up at an inconvenient time, say, during a work meeting, but I'm not engaging in a pattern of indefinite repression.) Even the "spinning out" about the past or the future, which may seem like it takes me away from being _present_, helps me to get a better grip on the present by understanding its place in the overall causality.

So I certainly embrace the term "wallowing", but I guess we need to be careful to not let it be used as an equivocation between proper leaning into discomfort and the pursuit of a self-destructive path.
