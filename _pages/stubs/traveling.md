* I like _being_ in different places and _visiting_ them, but I don't like _getting_ there. I like the destination, not the journey.
* _Traveling to and from_ a place is stressful for me, which often wipes out the benefit of vacations on the return trip.
* why I often prefer to drive than fly
  * my hatred of TSA and security theatre
  * the stress and frenzy of modality changes
* why I don't like to go on vacation alone, despite claiming to be an introvert
* the stress of planning trips and one-way doors
* my routines and comforts
* being bad at packing lightly
* camping
* my favorite places
  * ski resorts: Tahoe, Colorado
  * Hawai'i (especially Poipu, Kauai)
  * Atlanta
  * Tel Aviv
  * New York
