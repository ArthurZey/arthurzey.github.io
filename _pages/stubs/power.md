Here are a few things I'd like to discuss around power:

* power _to_ versus power _over_
* economic power versus political power
* ["The question I get asked by religious people all the time is, without God, what's to stop me from raping all I want? And my answer is: I do rape all I want. And the amount I want is zero. And I do murder all I want, and the amount I want is zero. The fact that these people think that if they didn't have this person watching over them that they would go on killing, raping rampages is the most self-damning thing I can imagine."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwebTX3rk3E){:target="&lowbar;blank"} (Penn Jillette)
  * relatedly, how "Absolute power corrupts absolutely." is a confession (Like, what is it that you're so tempted to do that the chief barrier to doing it is your lack of absolute power?)
* why I wear [The One Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Ring){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
  * my protest against a false view of power
  * my arrogance that I have a stronger will than Sauron
* relationship to my being a "[control](/control/) freak"; what [control](/control/) means to me (and relationship to P/J Myers-Briggs dichotomy)
   * relationship to my claustrophobia
* If I were Riker in [_Hide and Q_](https://trakt.tv/shows/star-trek-the-next-generation/seasons/1/episodes/10){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, would I accept infinite control over time, space, and matter? (Spoiler alert: Hell, _yes_.)
