description: "Whether in different aspects of life or looking at dispositions through different lenses, I think certain qualities naturally go hand-in-hand."

High-level ideas:
* mind, body, and spirit: intellectual development, bodybuilding, and psychological/emotional growth
* work and non-work life (_not_ work-life balance)
* being fundamentally the same person "at home" and "at work"; manifesting different aspects of yourself in contextually appropriate ways as not being a violation of authenticity

Not all of these qualities are under direct volitional control (they may take years of work to develop), but as I learn more about different ways of looking at and approaching various areas of life, these all seem like variations on the same basic theme:

* growth mindset
* secure attachment
* believing that people are generally doing the best that they can
* [believing that people's true interests are fundamentally harmonious](/harmony-of-interests/)
* egoism
* [rejection of authority](/rules/)
