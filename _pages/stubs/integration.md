description: "Whether in different aspects of life or looking at dispositions through different lenses, I think certain qualities naturally go hand-in-hand."

High-level ideas:
* mind, body, and spirit: intellectual development, bodybuilding, and psychological/emotional growth
* work and non-work life (_not_ work-life balance)
* being fundamentally the same person "at home" and "at work"; manifesting different aspects of yourself in contextually appropriate ways as not being a violation of authenticity

Not all of these qualities are under direct volitional control (they may take years of work to develop), but as I learn more about different ways of looking at and approaching various areas of life, these all seem like variations on the same basic theme:

* growth mindset
* secure attachment
* believing that people are generally doing the best that they can
* [believing that people's true interests are fundamentally harmonious](/harmony-of-interests/)
* [comfort with uncertainty](/objective-truth-and-comfort-with-uncertainty/)
* egoism
* [rejection of authority](/rules/) / being willful / independence / "being the wilderness" / immunity from conformity/peer-pressure
* believing in liberty / (classical) liberalism / (laissez-faire) capitalism / rejection of central planning
* being [process-oriented](/goal-oriented-is-process-oriented/)
* guilt talk (instead of shame talk)
* optimism
* positive identity and negative behaviors (as against negative identity)
* grit/tenacity

Other ideas to consider:
* [that episode of Russel Brand's podcast with Bren√© Brown](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Lfwf13k6AoDhrOuClU3Bx?si=jn8kO8DsQY20rlDLPnoA7A){:target="&lowbar;blank"} and that one point about her views leading inexorably to certain political views
* role of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)
* There's something about assuming that people aren't generally doing the best that they can that's associated with not feeling comfortable expressing needs (assuming others don't want to meet your needs?). If you assume people are generally doing the best that they can, it's easier, maybe, to hold them accountable and express ourselves and our needs. I was wondering what makes it hard to speak up for yourself and what you're wanting. I think it's partly (or perhaps most directly) premised on the idea that others aren't interested in meeting our needs. That seems like the premise that needs to be challenged.
* _Eventually_ experiencing compassion and empathy for an abuser can help you to understand what's going with them and that it is about _them_ and not about you or your own worthiness, lovability, etc. Compassion and empathy for someone who does horrifically bad things can only arise in the context of truly understanding/believing, in a subconsciously integrated way, that people are generally doing the best that they can, and they have failed to select appropriate goals and approaches to achieving them. It does _not_ excuse the behavior, but knowing that other people aren't being bad for the sake of being bad, that they are _trying_ to achieve values and happiness and prosperity (and are just horrifically mistaken, even willfully so in some ways) helps one to identify _oneself_ with the same idea and not condemn oneself too harshly or inappropriately. It helps with true, consistent integration, not just a superficial labeling of "abuser" to "deal with" one's own agony in being hurt. Subconsciously, I suspect that someone who can dismiss other people as inherently bad as a matter of _identity_ can't truly compartmentalize and experience themselves as fundamentally different. How you regard other people in your own mind strongly affects your own experience of their behavior. There's a connection here to a particular understanding of the idea of "unconditional love".
