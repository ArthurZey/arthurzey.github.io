description: "Whether in different aspects of life or looking at dispositions through different lenses, I think certain qualities naturally go hand-in-hand."

High-level ideas:
* mind, body, and spirit: intellectual development, bodybuilding, and psychological/emotional growth
* work and non-work life (_not_ work-life balance)
* being fundamentally the same person "at home" and "at work"; manifesting different aspects of yourself in contextually appropriate ways as not being a violation of authenticity

Not all of these qualities are under direct volitional control (they may take years of work to develop), but as I learn more about different ways of looking at and approaching various areas of life, these all seem like variations on the same basic theme:

* growth mindset
* secure attachment
* believing that people are generally doing the best that they can
* [believing that people's true interests are fundamentally harmonious](/harmony-of-interests/)
* [comfort with uncertainty](/objective-truth-and-comfort-with-uncertainty/)
* egoism
* [rejection of authority](/rules/) / being willful / independence / "being the wilderness" / immunity from conformity/peer-pressure
* being [process-oriented](/goal-oriented-is-process-oriented/)
* guilt talk (instead of shame talk)
* optimism
* positive identity and negative behaviors (as against negative identity)
* grit/tenacity

Other ideas to consider:
* [that episode of Russel Brand's podcast with Bren√© Brown](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Lfwf13k6AoDhrOuClU3Bx?si=jn8kO8DsQY20rlDLPnoA7A){:target="&lowbar;blank"} and that one point about her views leading inexorably to certain political views
* role of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)
