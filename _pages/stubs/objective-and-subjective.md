Look, I don't think that in any particular usage, many people are too confused by what anybody means when they characterize something as "subjective" or "objective". In that sense, you could say that such usages serve the purpose and interests of effective communication.

But my concern is a bit deeper than that: I'm worried about the _cognitive_ effect that using words too casually can have, particularly if there's some nuance that has subconscious effects. So my complaint is not fundamentally about communication, but about _thinking_. And I think that these two concepts in particular are critically important to understand to have clear thinking and to enable effective communication more generally, to say nothing of subtle psychological effects and confidence in ethical principles.

I think the core of the problem is that, regardless of the operative or implicit meaning that people attach to these terms when they use them, the prevalent connotation is the "subjective" is arbitrary and is more easily dismissed as such, and the "objective" is "really true" and beyond challenge.

Emphatically, I realize that my fixation with this issue--and my particular approach to understanding these concepts--is informed by Objectivism and departs from both colloquial usage _and_ "technical" usage in philosophy and academia in general. In a way, that's my whole point: The way these words are used is very muddled and imprecise, and that undermines clear thinking and, among other things, a proper understanding of [(objective) certainty and comfort with uncertainty](/objective-truth-comfort-with-uncertainty/).

I'll also quickly add that I want to use these terms in their _epistemological_ sense, not their _metaphysical_ sense. So what I'm concerned with is how "objective" and "subjective" are used to refer to a state of knowledge or ability to establish a truth through some mental process, _not_ about the status of some fact independent of a perceiver. For example, I'm not interested here in the phrase "objective fact" and using the word "objective" to underscore the absolutism of some fact. That facts and reality are what they are, independent of any observer or opinion or wish _is_ a premise of my viewpoint here, but when I use the word "objective", I'm talking about the _cognitive process_ in grasping those facts.

To avoid confusion on my usage (and this I don't think is _too_ controversial), I want to make clear that when I say "fact", I'm talking about what _is_, and when I say "truth", I'm talking about a mind's (accurately) _grasping_ what is.

I'll start with an inventory of how I've heard these words used that I'm objecting to:

|subjective|objective|
|-|-|
|personal|universal|
|situational|context-free|
|abstract|concrete|
|opinion-based|fact-based|
|controversial|uncontroversial|

Okay, so how do I use these words?

I take "objective" to mean something like "discoverable through a process of integrating observations and experiences in a logically non-contradictory way to understand or establish some claim, truth, or certainty". Objectivity is the _process_ of connecting observations to certainty about the facts of reality (including, emphatically, abstract facts that are not directly perceivable through the senses, such as claims about the virtue of honesty).

By contrast, I take "subjective" to mean something like "true _because_ I or society or some authority asserts, wishes, or believes it to be true". Subjectivity reflects the premise that there is no absolute reality and that _facts_ are invented by the mind. Only the staunchest academic philosophers would insist that even what's given in perception is "subjective" (eg, whether there is a fork on the table), so for most normal people, "subjective" ends up being used only to describe more abstract claims or beliefs. We'll get to that later, but I point it out now because it reflects that my understanding of "subjective" as an invalid cognitive orientation to truth is not all that controversial when it comes to concrete, directly perceptual matters.

(How to _objectively_ rely on experts is outside the scope of this post, and it's been covered pretty well by others already, and I'll try to dig up some links...)

Let's turn to each entry in my inventory of usage: [TO DO]

## Personal versus Universal

I often hear the word "subjective" used to describe something that depends on some personal, unique, or individualized factor. Matters of taste, aesthetic and culinary, readily fall into this category.

"Chocolate is my favorite flavor of ice cream." is my go-to example. A variant of this, if you want to make analysis of universality more explicit, is "Chocolate ice cream tastes better than vanilla.".

While it's often not used in the same breath, the implication seems to be that "objective" would mean that the fact applies to all people or is independent of people, that it's "universal". A great example might be something like "The Earth is round.".

But you'll still get some academic philosophers insisting that even "The Earth is round." is subjective, precisely because all observations leading to such a claim are ultimately based on observations of individual people, and, well, their sense perception and cognitive processes are "subjective" on this view of that term, no matter how much many (or all) people's "subjective" observations might correspond to one another's.

So even in the extreme cases of what we would think would uncontroversially be "objective" on this view of the meaning of those ideas, we are led to imprecision and fuzziness, something that most people wouldn't be able to (or want to) untangle. So how would we analyze the myriad issues in the middle? For instance:

* "Honesty is a virtue.": subjective or objective?
* "Honesty is ____." (fill in some definition): subjective or objective?
* "A virtue is ____." (fill in some definition): subjective or objective?
* "Ibuprofen is contraindicated for muscle-growth.": subjective or objective?

Let's look at this last one in particular. Its greyness really drives the point home. Surely, there are many physiological differences between people that make ibuprofen use more or less problematic for muscle synthesis, to say nothing of factors like dosage and timing. So is this a "subjective" or "objective" claim? Some will argue that it's "subjective" because it depends on the person. Others may more readily feel "objective" is the more appropriate characterization because, while the full/explicit/qualified context of the claim is omitted, it's meant to reflect a generality or statistical claim. (But even those folks often are not really able to defend that on sound philosophic grounds).

So here's the problem: What value have we really added by characterizing "Ibuprofen is contraindicated for muscle-growth." as either "subjective" or "objective"? Have we really added new understanding? Have we even aided communication and clarity? Maybe by calling it "subjective", we've gotten across the point that it depends on personal factors not explicit in the statement of the claim. But then why not use words we already have to characterize the nature of the claim, like "general", "typical", "usually", "depending on the person", etc? The problem with using a word like "subjective" here is that, given the connotation that the "subjective" is "arbitrary" and that the "objective" is "for real real", it both undermines the genuinely true aspects of the claim _and_ further erodes the idea that objective knowledge is possible at all. And at the risk of sounding dramatic, this ultimately renders everything some variant of "subjective", turning every discussion into a battle of whims. Strictly, that's based on a different meaning of the terms than "personal versus universal", but because of the connotations and that most people don't have clear definitions in their minds, "That is a subjective claim.", even if intended to reflect that it's based on individualized characteristics, ends up having the effect of "Your claim is as good as any other.". Few individual interactions may end up that extreme, but that is the trend I have observed time and again.

Okay, so what about calling that claim "objective"? Does that suffer similar problems? Well, _maybe_. While it seems like it has less directly the effect of rendering all knowledge arbitrary, the equation of "objective" with "universal" is still problematic and undermines clear thinking. For instance, imagine that this claim is false, that there's absolutely no correlation between ibuprofen and muscle synthesis. On the view that "objective" means "universal", one might still characterize the claim as "objective", just that it happens to be false. Fuzzy thinking abound! Think about what people mean to communicate when they say something like "That claim is objective." or even "That claim is objectively true.": They _really_ mean that the claim itself is _really really_ true. "Objective", in this context, is used to underscore the truthiness of some claim. Except in the narrowest, esoteric academic contexts, _nobody_ means that the claim is free of personal characteristics of the subject, but may itself still be true or false.

We urgently need a term to describe the soundness of the cognitive process that led to a claim, and that's what I'm saying "objective" properly refers to. To overload the term to mean "universal" or anything else, when we readily have the words to accurately capture what we're trying to get across, only leads to confusion, either immediately or down the line. The benefit of "my" understanding of "objective" is that it matches the existing connotation: When a person has gone through a logical cognitive process to reach a claim or belief, they are indeed entitled to assert their claim as _really really_ true, as _really really_ corresponding to the metaphysical facts. There may yet be further refinement and contextual nuance, and nobody is immune to error, but there needs to be _some_ standard for taking certain claims seriously and dismissing others. I think this is it.

An implication of my view, as applied to the personal-versus-universal nature of some claim, may strike people as counterintuitive or controversial or just plain ludicrous. If "objective" is independent of whether a claim depends on personal factors, statements like "Chocolate is my favorite flavor of ice cream." may well be objective. Why? Well, let's think through this: How is such a claim reached by a speaker? The speaker reflects on their experiences with different flavors of ice cream and introspects about their enjoyment of these various flavors, ultimately concluding that chocolate is the most enjoyable. (Let's assume here that that's what we mean by "favorite", and let's not quibble about whether the statement is meant to include all possible flavors of ice cream.) This, in pattern, is the same process that leads to any claim about anything, when done correctly. Indeed, assuming the speaker is not deluding themselves or failing to take certain facts or observations into account, this amounts to _really really_ true knowledge. This is an "objective" claim. Because establishing the truth of this claim depends on an almost entirely internal process, few others would have the requisite data to challenge the claim. As a result, they, too, would be able to _objectively_ claim that the speaker's favorite flavor of ice cream is chocolate, on the basis of information conveyed by the speaker, assuming they had good reason to trust the speaker's veracity. The process of reaching objective knowledge is different for the speaker than for others, but the point is that this claim about something personal to a person's tastes can be just as objective as "The Earth is round.". Let me put it more strongly: If "subjective" roughly means "true because I said so", no amount of my asserting that vanilla is my favorite flavor (however much I might even want that to be true) would actually make it _really really_ true, if, in fact, I derive more enjoyment from chocolate. The same goes for anybody else's claim about my favorite flavor. So what someone's favorite flavor of ice cream is is a matter of _metaphysical fact_, and like any fact, it's accurately discoverable through some cognitive process, which would render a claim about this fact "objective". Yes, favorite flavor depends on personal characteristics (taste buds and brain structure, for instance), but none of that is "subjective". We don't need the word "subjective" to underscore the personal nature of the fact; the word "personal" readily communicates that much more clearly and precisely.

There are also some interesting cases where a claim is phrased as though it's universal, such as "Chocolate ice cream tastes better than vanilla.", and then everybody gets wound up about whether that's true and what it means and then, more often than not, the issue is just dismissed as "subjective". I don't think that's helpful here. What's important to observe in statements like this is that a lot is implicit: There's no such thing as "taste" without a "taster", so _someone_ has to be the implicit taster. Or perhaps it's meant to be a statistical statement about which of chocolate or vanilla tastes better to _most_ people. To equate "subjective" and "objective" with "personal" and "universal", respectively, distracts from getting value out of this statement, since we dismiss the statement as "subjective", often before we're able to untangle what we really mean by the statement. If we operated on "my" view of "objective", the statement could more readily be approached as "There's an objective truth about the matter; what could it be?". Once you identify the implicit premises of the statement, it's clear to see how it's a matter of objective inquiry.

I hasten to reiterate that maybe few individual instances of using the words "subjective" and "objective" to mean "personal" and "universal", respectively, lead to immediate confusion in communication. The scope of that problem is beside my point. I'm more worried about the cognitive effects I sketched out above. I care about clear, effective communication, but I'm not a pragmatist: I'm not okay with "whatever gets my point across" in a given moment. It's why I'm a staunch opponent of non-words like "irregardless", even if they cause no immediate or direct confusion. It's a matter of being principled in language because the principle reflects a causality between language and long-term interests. More urgently than the needs of any instance of communication, I care about clear thinking; _that_ is the long-term interest my "fixation" serves, and _that_ is what ultimately facilitates effective communication consistently and sustainably.
