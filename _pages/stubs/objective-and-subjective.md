Look, I don't think that in any particular usage, many people are too confused by what anybody means when they characterize something as "subjective" or "objective". In that sense, you could say that such usages serve the purpose and interests of effective communication.

But my concern is a bit deeper than that: I'm worried about the _cognitive_ effect that using words too casually can have, particularly if there's some nuance that has subconscious effects. So my complaint is not fundamentally about communication, but about _thinking_. And I think that these two concepts in particular are critically important to understand to have clear thinking and to enable effective communication more generally, to say nothing of subtle psychological effects and confidence in ethical principles.

Emphatically, I realize that my fixation with this issue--and my particular approach to understanding these concepts--is informed by Objectivism and departs from both colloquial usage _and_ "technical" usage in philosophy and academia in general. In a way, that's my whole point: The way these words are used is very muddled and imprecise, and that undermines clear thinking and, among other things, a proper understanding of [(objective) certainty and comfort with uncertainty](/objective-truth-comfort-with-uncertainty/).

I'll also quickly add that I want to use these terms in their _epistemological_ sense, not their _metaphysical_ sense. So what I'm concerned with is how "objective" and "subjective" are used to refer to a state of knowledge or ability to establish a truth through some mental process, _not_ about the status of some fact independent of a perceiver. For example, I'm not interested here in the phrase "objective fact" and using the word "objective" to underscore the absolutism of some fact. That facts and reality are what they are, independent of any observer or opinion or wish _is_ a premise of my viewpoint here, but when I use the word "objective", I'm talking about the _cognitive process_ in grasping those facts.

To avoid confusion on my usage (and this I don't think is _too_ controversial), I want to make clear that when I say "fact", I'm talking about what _is_, and when I say "truth", I'm talking about a mind's (accurately) _grasping_ what is.

I'll start with an inventory of how I've heard these words used that I'm objecting to:

|subjective|objective|
|-|-|
|personal|universal|
|situational|context-free|
|abstract|concrete|
|opinion-based|fact-based|
|controversial|uncontroversial|

Okay, so how do I use these words?

I take "objective" to mean something like "discoverable through a process of integrating observations and experiences in a logically non-contradictory way to understand or establish some claim, truth, or certainty". Objectivity is the _process_ of connecting observations to certainty about the facts of reality (including, emphatically, abstract facts that are not directly perceivable through the senses, such as claims about the virtue of honesty).

By contrast, I take "subjective" to mean something like "true _because_ I or society or some authority asserts, wishes, or believes it to be true". Subjectivity reflects the premise that there is no absolute reality and that _facts_ are invented by the mind. Only the staunchest academic philosophers would insist that even what's given in perception is "subjective" (eg, whether there is a fork on the table), so for most normal people, "subjective" ends up being used only to describe more abstract claims or beliefs. We'll get to that later, but I point it out now because it reflects that my understanding of "subjective" as an invalid cognitive orientation to truth is not all that controversial when it comes to concrete, directly perceptual matters.

(How to _objectively_ rely on experts is outside the scope of this post, and it's been covered pretty well by others already, and I'll try to dig up some links...)

Let's turn to each entry in my inventory of usage: [TO DO]

## Personal versus Universal

## Situational versus Context-Free

## Abstract versus Concrete

## Opinion-based versus Fact-based

## Controversial versus Uncontroversial

[So why does this matter?]
