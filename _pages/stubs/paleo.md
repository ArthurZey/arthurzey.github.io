Angles to cover:

* how I got interested in Paleo in the first place
* low-carb "versus" Paleo
* evolutionary perspective in diet versus in psychology
* AIP (autoimmune protocol) and Whole30
* modern-day approximations
* the anti-concept of "processed foods"
* GMOs / organic foods
* Paleo "versus" bodybuilding goals
* presumptive safety versus claims of optimality
* burden of proof
* scientific backing
* claims for self versus claims for others
