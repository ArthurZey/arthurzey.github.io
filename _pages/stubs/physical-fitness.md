I imagine that this will likely end up being a whole section of examining physical fitness from different angles. My immediate purpose is to go into a bit of detail about why physical fitness occupies such a prominent place in my life and exactly how it manifests.

Here are a few areas I'd like to explore:

* media imagery: the role of cartoon depictions of superheroes and developmental concepts of masculinity
* consistency and integration: developing not only the mind, but also the body
* the body as a work of art (functional "versus" aesthetic goals)
* connection to physical health
* self-esteem versus second-handed approval-/attention-seeking
* shirtlessness: feeling sexy versus feeling wanted; pride versus flaunting
* the rebellion against shame triggers
* simultaneous feelings of pride _and_ revulsion when looking in the mirror
* the role of my genetics in why achieving fitness goals is so rewarding
* social stigma against judging / concern with the physical: "even deep waters have a surface"
