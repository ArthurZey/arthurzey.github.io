_The substance of blog posts is almost always date-specific...usually something that happened on a particular day. If you're looking for "timeless" content, head on over to [Stubs](/stubs/), where I've started a number of posts to capture some preliminary thoughts about various topics I want to explore. (As I flesh those out, they'll turn into proper, organized posts, rather than being in a "writing stubs" dumping ground!)_
